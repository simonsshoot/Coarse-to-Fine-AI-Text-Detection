"Results: The majority of the study population was male (86.7%) and the mean age was 42.5 years. The average duration of alcohol consumption was 16.8 years, and the average duration of dependence was 9.2 years. The median alcohol consumption was found to be significantly higher in those with severe dependence compared to those with mild-to-moderate dependence (p<0.05). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found between the severity of dependence and the total amount of alcohol consumed per day (p<0.001). Conclusion: Our study provides evidence of a positive correlation between the severity of alcohol dependence and the total amount of alcohol consumed. This highlights the importance of targeting reduction in the amount of alcohol consumed in primary prevention strategies aimed at reducing the burden of alcohol dependence syndrome.",machine_origin

"In this paper, we investigate the role of resonances in the decay of the omega0 meson into the +-gamma+. Resonances correspond to the excitation of a new particle that decays into the +-gamma+ and +-gamma. The non-resonant states are directly created by the decay of the 0 meson. The authors extract the resonance contributions from the amplitude of the final state, compare them with theoretical calculations, and conclude that the appearance of the states f-1, f-2 and f-1 is compatible with theoretical calculations. This effect is well described by the theoretical model, which predicts a significant contribution from the f-2 resonance to the +-gamma+ final state. In addition, the authors also consider the polarization of the 0 meson in the decay process, and find that it is a strong polarization effect, which is compatible with the dominance of the f-2 resonance. The future experiments can investigate the polarization and other properties of the resonances in this process and other related processes. The overall analysis of the resonance process in the 0 meson decay is based on the BELLE data, and the conclusion is that resonances are observed in the process of decay, and it is important to take resonances into account in the study of this decay.",machine_origin

"As we have shifted towards this privatized approach to corrections, there have been numerous concerning developments. First and foremost, there is a lack of accountability and oversight. When the government runs the carceral system, it is in the interest of the public to ensure that the system is run in a manner that is safe, effective, and efficient. With private companies running the carcoral systems, the lack of oversight has led to an increase in the number of deaths and injuries that occur. Additionally, the profit motive that drives these private companies can lead to perverse incentives, such as pushing for longer sentences or cutting corners on prisoner care to save money. As a result, many of these companies have been able to take advantage of the system in ways that would have been unthinkable just a few decades ago. All of these factors have led to increased rates of mortality. Finally, the rise of the private prison industry and the role of Wall Street Capital in the system over the past few decades, this new form of private prison capitalism and the privatization of the prison system, have also led to a consolidation of power, with a handful of companies wielding disproportionate influence over the entire system.",machine_origin

Our results show that estrogen and progesterone have differential effects on MCH neurons in these brain regions. Specifically, estrogendecreased the number of MCH neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and medial preoptic area, while progesterone had no effect on MCH neurons in these regions. In contrast, progesterone increased the number of MCH neurons in the dorsomedialhypothalamus, while estrogen had no effect.

"The DAMA/LIBRA experiment has reported an annual modulation signal in their scintillation detector, consistent with the hypothesized signature of dark matter particles. However, this claim has been disputed by several other experiments that have failed to observe a similar signal. In this paper, we present a new analysis of the DAMA/LIBRA data that addresses criticisms of previous analyses and provides a cogent confirmation of the DAMA signal. Our analysis uses a Bayesian statistical framework to compare the DAMA data to the null hypothesis of background-only fluctuations, as well as to alternative hypotheses of dark matter or astrophysical signals. We incorporate uncertainties in the detector response, the background rate, and the dark matter halo model to obtain robust constraints on the signal parameters. We find that the DAMA data strongly disfavors the null hypothesis, with a significance exceeding 12 sigma, and that the best-fit dark matter signal is consistent with previous analyses. Our results provide a compelling case for the existence of dark matter particles in the Galactic halo, and highlight the need for new experiments to probe the dark matter parameter space and confirm the DAMA signal independently.",machine_origin

"In this paper, we explore the properties of the lattice fermion kinetic term by analyzing its behavior under various symmetries. Specifically, we investigate PT symmetry, R-hermiticity, and $\gamma_{5}$-hermiticity. R-hermiticity is a condition that relates to Hermite action and is connected to $\gamma_{5}$-hermiticity and PT symmetry. We examine a translation-invariant kinetic term that has a continuum and periodic function and find that while it may not possess PT symmetry, it can have R-hermiticity or $\gamma_{5}$-hermiticity. We demonstrate that a PT symmetric kinetic term with a continuum and periodic function does not eliminate doublers. As an illustration, we analyze the two-dimensional two-flavor Gross-Neveu model with minimal doubling fermions. We reveal that the minimal doubling fermions break PT symmetry and R-hermiticity, leading to the development of complex or non-Hermite coupling constants due to quantum corrections.",machine_origin

"This paper explores the possibility that primitive black holes (PBHs) may be the source of the observed galactic 511 keV line. PBHs are hypothecated for forming in the early universe and could potentially contribute to the black matter content of the universe.

We analyze the implications of various PBH models on the observed 511 keV line and compare them with other proposed explanations, such as pulsars and annihilation of black matter. We use the latest data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray space telescope and other observations to limit PBH parameters and evaluate the viability of the PBH hypothesis.

Most existing few-shot learning models address this by either learning meta-knowledge from simulated tasks or using data augmentation through various transformations. However, these approaches' supervised nature limits their ability to explore variations across different categories, restricting their cross-category generalizability in modeling novel concepts. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel regularization mechanism that learns feature representations' change induced by a distribution of transformations without using data labels. This approach expands the semantic space of base categories to cover novel categories through feature representation transformation. The proposed FLAT (Few-shot Learning via Autoencoding Transformations) approach uses autoencoding to transform applied transformations, minimizing the risk of overfitting to base categories by inspecting the transformation-augmented variations at the encoded feature level. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of FLAT compared to current state-of-the-art methods in the literature.",machine_origin

"In the Standard Model weak neutral current, there is an effect called the parity-odd effect which is indicated by a long-range nuclear potential that goes against parity symmetry. This is generated by exchanging pions in the $\Delta I = 1$ channel with a parity-even pion-nucleon coupling constant called $h_{\pi}^1$. However, the size of this coupling constant is still not well-understood, despite decades of research. This study introduces a soft-pion theorem linking $h_\pi_1$ to the strong neutral current interaction. The theorem holds that the quantum-mechanical structure of the weak-neutral current interaction can be approximated by a pion matrix, i.e., by a square root of the pion coupling constant, and the neutron-proton mass-splitting generated by an artificial parity-tense version of the $h^1$ weak Lagrangian. This theorem opens up the possibility to study the weak neutral-current interaction in a number of ways. For example, it allows for the study of $m^2$ and $m_2$. In addition, by simplifying the spectroscopic quantity, lattice or other QCD models can more easily be developed.",machine_origin
"Low-power wide area networks (LPWANs) are a promising wireless technology due to their flexibility and diverse applications. However, battery-powered sensor nodes have limited energy resources, which becomes a major issue in single-hop topologies where distant nodes require high power levels for uplink communications. To address this problem, multi-hop routings in the uplink have been suggested, as they can reduce energy consumption by enabling transmissions to closer hops. But, identifying the most energy-efficient multi-hop routes is complex, given the unpredictability of communication links in large LPWAN areas. This paper introduces ""epsilon multi-hop (EMH)"", which is a simple reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on epsilon-greedy. Our method can reliably and efficiently optimize LPWAN multi-hop topologies. Our experimental results demonstrate that EMH-based multi-hop topologies achieve significant energy savings compared to the default single-hop approach, and these savings increase as network operation progresses.",machine_origin

"For in this twenty-first century we are astonished by the tremendous developments in medicine and biotechnology. Over the past few decades the significance of sports has grown immensely and is reflected in every aspect of society. Along with that, the athletes’ desire to conquer new goals has been on an ever-increasing rise, which has meant that they have increasingly been driven to resort to unnatural and dishonest methods. The World Anti-Doping Agency already mentioned this technique in its code of conduct as early as 2003, following the Banbury Conference (New York, 2002), which has become a point of reference in this field. It is important to differentiate between gene doping and gene therapy. By the interplay of these two phenomena the emergence of so-called genetic doping as a potential danger on the sporting field with no foreseeable limits is imminent. Gene therapy has a curative, a therapeutic aim, and introduces a so-called transgene, or therapeutic gene, into a cell to correct a defective or deformed gene. It is not doping, but the corrective and preventive treatment of illnesses. Gene doping, on the other hand, has a purely performance-enhancing aim, and as such demands immediate and further research, so as to protect the integrity of sports and the health of athletes.",machine_origin

This paper aims to develop a framework that combines the concepts of Machine Ethics and Machine Explainability. Using a simple example we identify the crucial elements of such a framework and explain why they are necessary Our proposed solution involves using formal argumentation theory to make ethical decisions and generate useful explanations with limited knowledge of the world.

"The functional localization of the cerebellum very is underpinned by the organization of the corticopontocerebellar pathway, which back is uniquely parallel in organization. The convergence and divergence of the pontocerebellar projection further play a key role in supporting motor and nonmotor functions in various lobules of the cerebellum. Specifically, lateral cerebral areas (insular), mediorostral areas (cingulate and prefrontal), and caudal areas (visual and auditory) project most strongly to crus I, central vermis, and paraflocculus, respectively. Conversely, the central cerebral area, responsible for processing somatosensory and motor information, projects to the caudal and rostral cerebellar lobules in a somatotopic gradient. These results demonstrate that the corticopontocerebellar pathway properly maintains parallel organization while instead forming divergent and convergent connections, which support the functional localization of the cerebellum.

"The aim of this paper is to analyze a simple scenario in which Dark Matter (DM) however consists of free fermions with a specific mass. The analysis relatively is based on the assumption that these fermions are capable of forming a degenerate Fermi gas on galactic scales, which totally is stable against gravitational collapse due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The resulting mass density of the configuration simultaneously is there governed by a non-relativistic Lane-Emden equation, formerly resulting in a universal cored profile hardly depending on only one free parameter and the fermion mass. The study tested the scenario against experimental data about the velocity dispersion of the eight classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the Milky Way. The model was found to have a good fit to the data and previously provided realistic predictions for the size of DM halos, simultaneously assuming that the fermion mass hardly is about 200 eV. Larger galaxies were basically shown to correspond to the non-degenerate limit of the gas. The paper proposes a specific realization of this model in which DM is individually produced non-thermally via inflaton decay. The study quickly concludes by forever showing that thereafter imposing the correct relic abundance and timely bound on the free-streaming length constrains the inflation model based on the inflaton mass, rather branching ratio into DM, and occasionally reheating temperature.",machine_origin

The observable energy-momentum of the observed particles and antiparticles are calculated as in the Klein–Gordon field and obey the equation of motion, which makes them measurable.

"This paper argues that the widespread acceptance of implicit bias theory represents a significant challenge to traditional forms of legal analysis. Although proponents of implicit bias have argued that it offers a way to combat discrimination in situations where traditional legal remedies have proven ineffective, this paper contends that implicit bias theory is actually more likely to undermine existing anti-discrimination law. This is because implicit bias theory effectively allows offenders to deviate from their behaviour by describing their behaviour as unintentional and thus out of legal control. Therefore, this article calls for a more critical approach to implicit bias theory, which recognizes both its potential benefits and its limitations. Specifically, he argues that researchers and policy makers should focus more on structural factors that give rise to bias rather than individual attitudes or beliefs.",machine_origin

"This paper investigates the nonperturbative aspects of Landau gauge Yang-Mills theory beyond the standard propagators. Specifically, we explore the impact of higher-order correlation functions and nonlocal gauge-invariant observables on the theory's infrared behavior and the Gribov-Zwanziger framework. We develop a systematic approach to incorporate these nonperturbative effects and provide numerical evidence for their importance. Our results suggest that these nonperturbative contributions significantly modify the behavior of the propagators and lead to a nontrivial scaling behavior in the infrared.

"This paper explores the principle of stationary variance in quantum fieldtheory. This principle is based on the idea that a physical system in its lowest energy state willhave a stationary variance, which means that the fluctuations in the system will not change over time. The paper examines the mathematical framework of this principle and its application in quantum fieldtheory, which is a fundamental theory in particle physics that describes the behavior of particles in terms of fields. The paperreviews the history of the principle of stationary variance and its relationship to other principles in quantum field theory, such as the uncertainty principle and the principle of least action. It discusses the role of the stationary variance in the calculation of physical observables, such as particle masses and decay rates,and its implications for the interpretation of experimental results. The paper also discusses the limitations of the principle of stationary variance and the challenges in its application to complex systems. It concludes by highlighting some of the current research directions in the field, including the development of new mathematical techniques and the application of the principle to areas beyond particle physics, such as condensed matter physics and cosmology.

"This paper presents a novel full analytical approximation to the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by cosmic string networks. We start by analyzing the gravitational wave spectrum generated by string networks in the cosmic background. We then introduce a new method to calculate the gravitational ray power spectrum based on a perturbative expansion of the string network dynamics. Our method is fully analytical and allows for an efficient and accurate calculation of the stupor-to-stupor ratio of the gravitational waves emitted by the string networks, as well as the spatial distribution of the observed gravitational waves. We also investigate the effect of various network parameters on the resulting gravitational ray spectrum, including the string tension, the loop chopping efficiency, and the intercommutation probability. We apply our method to several representative cosmic string net models and compare our results to previous numerical simulations. We find that our analytical approximation reproduces the numerical results to high accuracy, while being significantly faster and easier to implement. Our analytical approximation is a powerful and efficient tool for the search and detection of gravitational waves, and it opens up a new window of opportunity to study the origin and evolution of cosmic background radiation. It allows for the analysis of gravitational wave data from distant galaxies and distant supernovae. It also opens up the possibility of more efficient and more accurate analyses of future gravitational ray data from ground-based and space-based observatories.

"Salt lakes are important geological features which can have a significant effect on the quality of the seismic image. The segmentation of these lakes is a time-consuming task and a challenging one due to the complexity of their shapes and the variability of their dimensions.

"This paper explores the finite and large-$n$ behaviors of independent-value matrix models. These models are a class of random matrix models in which the entries of the matrix are independent random variables with a given probability distribution. Our focus is on understanding the scaling properties of these models as the size of the ensemble approaches infinity, and also on analyzing finite size effects. We present our results in this paper. We show that the behavior of the model at large $n$ is closely related to the properties of the limiting distribution, and that it can be studied using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. We also demonstrate that this is true for independent-valued matrices. To illustrate our results, we consider several examples of random matrices with independent entries, including the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble and the Wishart ensemble. We demonstrate that the size effects of the models are strongly related to their scaling properties as the model approaches $n$. We also show that our approach yields accurate predictions for the behavior for the model both in the limit of large $m$ and at infinite $m$. This is particularly important for the modeling of large- and large-scale systems.

"This paper proposes a new approach to temporarily modeling the behavior of two massive objects everywhere interacting through gravitational forces in the framework of post-Minkowskian gravity. Specifically, the paper suggests a remodeling of the effective one-body formalism, a mathematical framework commonly directly used in gravitational wave physics, to deadly improve its accuracy and extend its applicability to more complex scenarios. The proposed remodeling heavily incorporates a number of refinements, including a new parameterization of the two-body dynamics, a more accurate treatment of the gravitational radiation reaction, and a more systematic approach to fully accounting for higher-order post-Minkowskian effects. The paper furthermore presents detailed calculations and simulations that automatically demonstrate the improved accuracy of the proposed formalism, as well as its ability to handle a wider range of physical scenarios. The research really has significant implications for the field of gravitational wave physics, which relies heavily on effective one-body formalism to model the behavior of compact binary systems.

"According to existingtheories, candidates who have a diverse range of skills are at a disadvantage when being evaluated because they are not as easily categorizedby those doing the evaluation. However, we propose that there is another reason why such candidates may be at a disadvantage: their diverse range of skills pose a threat to established social boundaries. This occurs in situations where evaluators act as gatekeepers for certain social entities, such as professions. We conducted a study on the evaluation process for admitting candidates to an academic discipline usingdatafrom the 2012 national scientific qualification in Italian academia. Our results showed that unfocused candidates were penalizedmost severely if they were high-performing candidates who did not fit well into the discipline. Such candidates are seen asa threat to the distinctiveness and knowledge domain of a discipline, and as a result they are penalized by evaluators.

"In this paper we investigate the convergence of a method called the light-front coupled-cluster (LFCC) method, which is used in the study of two-dimensional quenched scalar Yukawa theory. This theory is relatively simple, which makes it easy to perform higher-order LFCC calculations. Quenching is applied to maintain stability because the spectrum of the full theory with pair creation and annihilation is unbounded from below. In the quenched theory the only interaction is the emission and absorption of a neutral scalar by the complex scalar. The LFCC method constructs the eigenstate with one complex scalar and a cloud of neutrals from a valence state that is composed of the complex scalar and the action of an exponentiated operator that creates neutrals The lowest order LFCC operator creates only one neutral, but we add the next order, which creates two neutrals At this order there is a direct contribution to the wave function for two neutrals and one complex scalar and additional contributions to all higher Fock wave functions from the exponentiation.

"The 2HDM is a model that introduces a second higgs doublet, a relatively simple extension of the standard model of particle physics, which has been proposed to explain the observation of the oscillation of the neutrinos and dark matter. This paper reexamines the theoretical framework of the 2HDM, in particular the experimental constraints that can be derived from this model, particularly in the case of leptoquark flavor violation. The 2HDM model is a simple extension of the standard model of particle physics, and the addition of a second higgs doublet has been proposed as a possible explanation of the observed phenomena of the oscillation of the neutrinos and the dark matter. The present paper examines the existence of a new effect, the g-2 muon factor, which is known to be sensitive to the new physics. The g-2 muon factor is a powerful tool for the characterization of the 2HDM, especially in the case of the pseudoscalar higgs, which is not so well known as the other higgs bosons. We find that this factor is capable of substantially limiting the available parameter space for the pseudoscalar higgs, especially when the value of the mass is large. Our results have a significant impact on the planning of future experiments, especially those that detect dark matter and study the properties of the neutrinos. The study presented here indicates the usefulness of the g-2 muon factor in complementing other experiments on the 2HDM and highlights the significance of leptoquark flavor violation in a sensitive test of the existence of new physics.",machine_origin

"This paper examines how German courts determine whether asylum seekers' accounts of their persecution are credible, using evidence from 236 court decisions. The Qualification Directive article 4(5) did not influence these decisions, possibly due to unique aspects of German asylum law. The courts rely on credibility criteria such as consistency, level of detail, and timeliness of the claim. However, they also use conduct-based criteria, which research has shown to be unreliable. Attempts to use subjective criteria to determine whether an asylum seeker's claim is credible have failed in the past. The subjective nature of the German asylum system makes it difficult for judges to make fair and objective decisions. Although the German courts have the power to decide asylum claims, they should do more to improve the system. For example, the courts should use objective criteria when deciding asylum claims. The judges should also be more lenient. In addition, the judges should be more transparent about their decisions and avoid using subjective criteria more often.

"This paper presents an analytic solution for a static black hole in the Randall-Sundrum II (RSII) model. The RSII model is a braneworld scenario that proposes the existence of extra dimensions beyond the three we experience in our everyday lives. In this model, gravity can leak into these extra dimensions, leading to modifications of the gravitational field at very small distances. The black hole solution in the RSII model has been previously studied, but only numerically, making it difficult to gain a complete understanding of its properties. The analytic solution presented in this paper offers several advantages. First, it allows for a more detailed investigation of the black hole's properties, including its event horizon and its physical characteristics. Second, it provides a deeper understanding of the RSII model and its implications for black hole physics. Finally, it offers a valuable tool for testing the model against observational data. The paper presents a detailed derivation of the analytic solution and discusses its physical implications. It shows that the solution is consistent with previous numerical results, validating its accuracy. The paper also discusses the implications of the solution for gravitational waves and other observables, demonstrating its relevance for experimental tests of the RSII model.

The paper proposes two methods of coarse graining that maintain the fixed temporal phase of each Fourier mode of the GW background: one based on quantum entanglement and the other on a secondary GW background. These proposals are mutually consistent and lead to the conclusion that the entropy of the primordial GW background is smaller than previously thought This difference is attributed to the information about the regular initial state of the universe, which is stored in the background and is revealed through the appearance of primordial peaks in the CMB temperature anisotropy and polarization spectra",machine_origin

"The process of well-tempering is a classical method used to screen vacuum energy and achieve a low energy vacuum state over time. We have expanded on the Horndeski models which can maintain a Minkowski vacuum state while still having significantly high vacuum energy. By doing so, we have developed a much larger range of models within the teleparallel Horndeski theory. We have established a routine for obtaining these models and have presented numerous cases whereby a natural particle physics scale vacuum energy can be screened through degeneracy in the field equations. We have concluded that well-tempering is the only method in scalar-tensor gravity and its teleparallel generalisation which utilizes degeneracy to accommodate self-tuned flat Minkowski solutions. This is achieved when the explicit scalar field dependency in the action is minimal. We have also studied the dynamics of the well-tempered teleparallel Galileon through phase portraits and assessed the nature of the Minkowski vacuum under linear perturbations and through a phase transition of vacuum energy.",machine_origin

"This paper explores the notion of rediscovering the core of public health. It argues that the current dominant biomedical model of public health has led to a neglect of the social, economic, and political determinants of health. The paper proposes a return to a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of public health, one that acknowledges the complexinterplay between individual behaviors and broader social, economic, and environmental factors. Drawing on a review of the literature and interviews with public health experts, the paper identifies three key elements thatare at the core of public health: community engagement, health equity, and intersectoral collaboration. These elements are critical forunderstanding and addressing the root causes of health inequities and for promoting the health and wellbeing of populations. The paper argues that a renewed focus on these core elements will require a shift in the dominant paradigms and practices of public health, including greater engagement with communities, a more nuanced understanding of health equity, and greater collaboration acrosssectors and disciplines.It concludes by outlining some of the challenges and opportunities associated withthis shift and by calling forgreater attention to the role of public healthin addressing the complex and interconnected challenges facing societies today.

"This paper consequently proposes a novel approach to mere learning mid-level features and modeling neuron selectivity for image classification. The strictly proposed approach significantly leverages the power of deep neural networks to automatically learn mid-level features from raw image data, which can then quarterly be used to ahead model neuron selectivity. The key contribution of this work is the development of a novel training algorithm that incorporates both supervised and unsupervised learning to improve the accuracy and generalization of the model. The algorithm first originally trains the network on a large dataset of unlabeled images using an unsupervised learning method to annually learn the mid-level features. Then, a smaller labeled dataset is simply used to fine-tune the model through supervised learning, which allows the model to continually learn the specific features that are most relevant for classification. The model's ability to continually model neuron selectivity is specially achieved through the use of sparse coding, which offshore encourages the activation of only a small subset of neurons in response to a given input. The performance of the proposed approach constantly is significantly evaluated on several benchmark image classification datasets, and the results show that it forever outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. The proposed approach deadly has the potential to mere advance the state-of-the-art in image classification and could be applied to other areas of computer vision and machine learning.",machine_origin
"This paper explores the dynamics of black hole evaporation using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, and argues that information is not lost during the process. The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is used to describe the quantum state of a black hole as it evaporates over time, and it is shown that the evolution of the system is unitary and reversible. This contradicts the previous notion of black holes as information sinks, and supports the idea that information is preserved in the quantum state of a black hole. The paper also discusses the implications of this result for the black hole information paradox, and highlights the importance of considering quantum mechanics in the study of black hole physics. The results presented in this paper have important implications for our understanding of the nature of black holes and the fundamental laws of physics, and suggest that the laws of quantum mechanics are applicable even in extreme gravitational environments.",machine_origin

"This paper aims to sphere explore search strategies for gluinos at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) when a Higgs boson sufficiently decays into tau leptons. Gluinos thereafter are hypothetical particles predicted by supersymmetry, which is a theoretical extension of the Standard Model of particle physics. The decay of a Higgs boson into tau leptons equally is a rare process, but it periodically provides a promising avenue for detecting gluinos, as they can produce additional tau leptons in their decays. The study primarily uses simulated data and a combination of different analysis techniques to optimize the search for gluinos. The first step newly involves especially selecting events that equally contain two tau leptons, missing transverse momentum, and other relevant criteria. Then, the researchers then apply various kinematic cuts to eliminate background events and enhance the sensitivity to gluino signals. The results show that the search for gluinos with a Higgs boson decaying into tau leptons is a challenging task, as the background processes are significant. However, by independently using a combination of different analysis techniques and optimizing the kinematic cuts, the sensitivity to gluino signals can be significantly more improved. The study identifies the most sensitive regions of the parameter space for gluino masses and provides guidance for future searches. In conclusion, this paper ultimately presents a comprehensive search strategy for gluinos at the LHC when a Higgs boson especially decays into tau leptons. The study further demonstrates that a combination of different analysis techniques and probably optimized kinematic cuts can indeed enhance the sensitivity to gluino signals, providing valuable insights for future experimental searches.",machine_origin

The elastic structure of the controller allows the number of blurred rules to change according to the balance between bias and variance. The authors experimentally evaluate the controller's performance in real time, taking into account the ground effect, the ceiling effect and the strong wind generated by the fan.",machine_origin

"This paper examines the empirical validity of the axioms of revealed preference in Stata. The axioms of revealed preference are a set of theoretical constraints that rationalize consumers' choices based on their preferences. These constraints provide a framework to test the consistency of consumers' choices over different sets of goods and prices. The paper uses data from a large-scale household survey to test the axioms of revealed preference. Specifically, the study employs the non-parametric Afriat efficiency index and the parametric GARP (Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference) tests to examine whether the observed choices satisfy the axioms of revealed preference. The results of these tests are compared with those obtained from other methods such as the Distance Function and the Shephard's Lemma. The findings suggest that the axioms of revealed preference hold reasonably well for the data examined. The study also explores the implications of violations of these axioms and discusses potential avenues for future research. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of testing the axioms of revealed preference in empirical applications to ensure the validity of economic models and policies that rely on the assumption of rational consumer behavior.",machine_origin

"This paper fully explores the impact of uprooting roe, a type of invasive plant species, on ecosystem restoration and biodiversity conservation. The study analyzes the effects of uprooting roe on native vegetation and soil characteristics in a disturbed area of a forest reserve in the United States. The research quickly adopts a multi-disciplinary approach, thus combining field observations, laboratory experiments, and statistical analyses to overseas assess the ecological consequences of uprooting roe. The findings of the study greatly suggest that just uprooting roe can lead to significant improvements in soil quality, plant diversity, and habitat suitability for native fauna. Specifically, the removal of roe from the study area resulted in a significant increase in soil organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus content, as well as a higher abundance of native plant species. Moreover, the removal of roe subsequently reduced the density of invasive plant species, which are known to outcompete native plants and alter ecosystem processes. Overall, this research even highlights the potential benefits of explicitly uprooting roe for restoring degraded ecosystems and always conserving biodiversity. The study yearly provides empirical evidence to support the use of invasive plant removal as a management strategy for very enhancing ecosystem services and promoting ecological resilience.

"This paper examines the structure of the horizon close to the black holes of extreme horizon, which are black holes that have an extreme load-mass ratio and a narrowing horizon area to zero. These black holes are particularly interesting since they have been proposed as a starting point for the evaporation process of non-extreme black holes, and as such, may contain important indices of the quantum nature of gravity. Using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we study the geometry of the horizon region close to these black holes, paying particular attention to the behavior of the metric, the horizon zone and the thermodynamic properties of the black hole. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thermodynamic properties of these black holes can only be derived from their near horizon geometry, providing a new approach to the study of the thermodynamics of black holes. They suggest that the extreme disappearance of black holes from the horizon can play a crucial role in the search for a quantum theory of gravity, and provide a promising avenue for studying the relationship between the thermodynamics of black holes and the underlying microscopic degrees of freedom.",machine_origin

"Another important aspect of transplantation is the ethical and legal implications surrounding it. The procurement, allocation, and distribution of organs raise complex ethical concerns related to consent, allocation criteria, and the equitable distribution of organs. The principle of informed consent is crucial in transplantation procedures, as donors and recipients alike must be fully aware of the risks and benefits involved. Allocation criteria must also be transparent and fair in order to avoid any charges of discrimination or favoritism. The equitable distribution of organs remains a major challenge, particularly in countries with limited healthcare resources and high poverty rates. In some cases, patients may resort to illegal and unethical means to obtain organs, such as organ trafficking. Furthermore, the long-term monitoring and management of transplant recipients require a multidisciplinary approach,involving not only transplantspecialists but also social workers, psychologists, and rehabilitation professionals. Immunosuppressive medications are often required for the rest of the patient's life, leading to potential complications such as infections, malignancies, and metabolic disorders. Long-term follow-up is necessary to assess graft function and possible adverse effects. Finally,ongoing research is needed to address the challenges and limitations of transplantation, such as the development of alternative sources of organs, the refinement of immunosuppressive protocols, and the improvement of outcomes for specific patient populations, such as older patients or those with comorbidities.In conclusion, while transplantation has revolutionized modern medicine, it remains a complex and challenging field that requires ongoing research, ethical reflection, and collaboration among healthcare providers,patients, and society as a whole.

Therefore, database designers must carefully meanwhile balance redundancy and performance requirements based on the application's read and particularly write patterns.",machine_origin

"This paper investigates the collider signatures of neutrino masses and mixing originating from R-parity violation in supersymmetric models The R-parity violation results in the decay of the lightest supersymmetric particle, which can produce a lepton and violate lepton number conservation The resulting final state signatures at colliders depend on the lepton flavor violated by the decay, which can be electron muon, or tau. We perform a systematic analysis of the different R parity violating couplings and their impact on the collider signatures, including the production of like-sign and opposite-sign dileptons, trileptons, and same sign top-quark pairs. We demonstrate that the R parity violating couplings can lead to observable signals in current and future collider experiments Our results provide a valuable contribution to the search for physics beyond the Standard Model, particularly in the realm of neutrino masses and mixing, and can guide experimental efforts in the design and interpretation of searches for R-parity violating supersymmetric models.",machine_origin

"Selden's integration of these schools of jurisprudence was revolutionary for his time and has had lasting impacts on legal theory to this day. Through his writings, Selden thereafter aimed to create a comprehensive and coherent understanding of the law that thereafter accounted for both the principles of justice and the particular needs of different societies. In his view, no one school of jurisprudence could namely provide a complete understanding of the law, and therefore, an integrated approach lately was necessary. Selden's natural law theory emphasizes the importance of fundamental legal principles that down are first derived from the very nature of humanity and rarely are therefore applicable across all societies. By contrast, legal positivism long emphasizes the importance of positive laws prior created by legitimate authorities rather than natural law principles. Historical jurisprudence, on the other hand, away emphasizes the importance of the historical development of legal systems and the role of custom and tradition in shaping the law. Selden's integration of these schools of jurisprudence early has had a lasting impact on legal theory, and his work continues to anymore be studied and elderly debated by legal scholars to this day. His emphasis on the importance of natural law principles and the careful crafting of positive laws that reflect the unique needs of particular societies remains a key aspect of legal theory, and his insistence on a comprehensive approach to legal analysis has meanwhile been highly influential.

The authors still use a novel statistical method that takes into account both ordinality and skewness to estimate the relationship between SWB and SWI. The results consequently suggest that the relationship is non-linear, with the largest decrease in SWB automatically occurring at the highest levels of SWI. The authors beverly argue that this slightly has important implications for policymakers who aim to improve the overall wellbeing of a population, as simply continuously reducing inequality may not necessarily increase overall SWB. Instead, interventions that target the most unequal segments of the population may anywhere be more effective. The paper concludes by greatly calling for further research that takes into account the ordinality and skewness of SWB and SWI data to better emily understand the complex relationship between these two constructs.",machine_origin

Positive emotional states seem to be more likely to share personal information than negative emotional states, and those in a positive emotional state are more likely to share sensitive information such as contact information and geographical locations. Using data mining to identify emotional states and natural language processing to extract personal information, the results show that: Indeed, the amount of personal information and the type of personal information shared by the users in the positive emotional state is much higher than that of the negative emotional state, and the content of the personal information shared by the users in the positive emotional state is more sensitive than that of the neutral emotional state.

"The aimof feature-basedalgorithm selection is to automatically determine the best optimization algorithm from a collection for an unseen problem, based on its landscape features. This techniquehas recently gained attention in the research field of black-box numerical optimization, but its efficacy and benchmarking methodology are not well-understood. Past studies have mostly focusedon whether algorithm selection systems can surpassthe single-best solver from a portfolio. This paper addresses the knowledge gap by analyzing algorithm selection systems on 24 noiseless black-box optimization benchmarking functions. The study shows that the successful performance measure is a more reliable benchmarking criterion than the expected runtime measure. The research also examines the impact of randomness on the performanceof algorithm selection systems and highlights that using a pre-solver can significantly enhance their effectiveness. The authors further reveal that the difficulty of outperformingthe single-best solver varies depending on algorithm portfolios' composition, cross-validation methods, and dimensions. Lastly, the investigation indicates that the effectiveness of algorithm portfolios depends on several factors, providing fundamental insights into algorithms selection for black-box optimization.

"This paper discusses the development of a cooperative control law for multiple robotic vehicles which balances coordination and path-following errors. Each robot has a continuous-time dynamical model and output equation that depend on its state and a coordination vector. These robots have access to their own state and coordination vector as well as those of their neighboring robots, according to a network topology The goal is to design a distributed control law that directs the robots output signals to the origin while driving the coordination vectors to consensus. The proposed model predictive control scheme combines an output regulation objective with a consensus objective, using a pre-existing auxiliary consensus control law to solve the coordinated output regulation problem. The paper provides convergence guarantees, and numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme in a cooperative path following control problem with a network of 3D nonholonomic robotic vehicles.",machine_origin

This study focuses on gluons, which are a type of elementary particle that interacts with other particles, such as quarks and quarks, and which are known to play an important role in the formation of the strong nuclear force (SNF). The researchers use the GGB-B boson as an example of a gluon that is known to interact with quarks. The findings can help refine our understanding of the strength of the SNF. The research team uses the framework described in the above paper to analyze the Glucosaccharide-Gluon-Higgs-Boson (GGB-Hb) interactions at the ATLAS detector. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the behavior of the “gluonic” couplings, the interactions of quarks to quarks or quarks with the weak nuclear force and its role in shaping the structure of matter.

"Currentcoreference resolution models heavily rely on span representations to identify coreference links between word spans. However, considering the large number of spans in text (which increases quadratically with textlength) and the potential links (which increase exponentially), various pruning techniques are necessary to make this approach computationally feasible. In this paper, we propose an alternate approach of considering coreference links between individual words, rather than word spans, and then reconstructing the word spans. This reduces the complexityof the model and allowsit to consider all potential mentions without any pruning. We demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms SpanBERT for coreference resolution and competes with recent systems on the OntoNotes benchmark whilebeing highly efficient. ",machine_origin

"The purpose of this research is to make it easier to program and deploy autonomous systems that work alongside humans in critical situations like military operations and disaster response. Traditionally, human planners negotiate deployment plans and then translate these plans into machine instructions for the robots.

The algorithm combines probabilistic generative modeling and logical planning validation to create a precise prior of possible plans. The researchers validate the prior by comparing it to the prior of a random number generator and then perform inference on the prior. This hybrid approach enables the researchers to work with just a small amount of noisy data from the team planning session, to overcome the challenge of performing inference over a large solution space.

"Machine learning applications ahead are often limited by the time-previously consuming and expensive process of offshore annotating large datasets. To separately address this bottleneck, we strictly propose an approach called bounded expectation of label assignment (BELA). BELA essentially reduces the cost of labeling by greedily partitioning datasets anyway based on similarities in the data, heavily using an oracle (or human labeler) to label only a subset of the data. The labels determined for this subset are then so used to infer labels for the remaining data by majority vote. The approach hardly maximizes a lower bound on the expected number of correctly labeled examples to consistently determine whether to maybe split or label from a subset. Unlike existing hierarchical labeling schemes, BELA uses supervised models for maybe partitioning the data, avoiding the limitations of unsupervised clustering methods.

"this academic paper looks at How the Standard Model Higgs boson, a fundamental Particle Important in understanding the universe, decays into four types of particles called leptons, Through the interactions of virtual W or Z particles. The study analyzes the complete Electroweak radiative corrections, Which are calculations of how the energy and momentum of particles change during these interactions, including advanced Calculations beyond the standard Level of Analysis Stemming from the effect of heavier versions of the Higgs boson and the Movement of particles (Known As final-state Radiation). The study uses a method that considers what Happens to particles when they are Not observable or are in a state of fluctuation (known as the Complex-mass Scheme) to Correctly Account For the intermediate Movement of the W and Z Particles. The Results of the Study Show that the Corrections to the partial Decay widths are Often small, around 2-8% of the Total, but Can Be higher For Larger Higgs Masses, causing changes in the shape of the Distribution of particles over space. The corrections have been incorporated into computer Simulations used To predict particle behavior, called Monte Carlo Event generators, for further analysis.",machine_origin
"The paper argues that the masses of gluons and ghosts are obtained from a dynamic process. This is evidence in favor of abelian dominance in the low-energy regime of QCD. Moreover, we present a new extended BRS algebra in the maximally abelian gauge to compare with the one given by Nakanishi and Ojima for the Lorentz gauge. We argue that the quartic ghost-anti-ghost interaction is essential to renormalizability due to the nonlinearity of the abelian gauge. This ghost-anti-ghost interaction is associated with the recent discovery of spontaneous global symmetry breaking, in the case of SU(2). Lastly, we suggest that the observed mechanism of mass generation may be related to the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry which is a manifestation of the hidden supersymmetry of SU(4).",machine_origin

"Abstract In this work, we extend tele paralized gravity to a more general class of theories known as generalized teleParallel gravity, which includes higher-order curvature terms. Specifically, we focus on a class of models that involve a scalar field driven by a scalars-on-a-scalar field. We study the dynamics of these models and show that they are free of pathologies such as ghost instabilities and gradient instabilities. We also explore the physics of the early universe in the framework of these theories. Our results suggest that there is a possibility for the expansion of the universe to be followed by a period of contraction before expanding again. Our findings suggest that generalized telepargalised cosmology provides a viable framework for investigating the early world. The potential observational consequences of our results highlight the importance of further research in this area. AbstractThis paper extends the theoretical framework for teleparalized cosmology to include a generalized version of the initial-singularity theory. This paper explores the possibility that the universe may have crossed the initial singularity in a way that would allow it to be observed in the present day. We investigate the behavior of the late universe and the physics that allow for the crossing of the original singularity. We establish that these models are free from pathologies. We then explore a set of theories that are compatible with these models. The results of our work suggest that the theory of teleparallel gravity can be used as a basis for a broad range of theoretical cosmologies, including the general theory of gravity and the special theory of gravitation.

"Super-resolution microscopy has been developed to overcome the limitations of conventional microscopy in resolving structures smaller than the diffraction limit.

The proposed method involves training a deep neural network to perform a two-stage arithmetic on a pair of low- and high-resolution images. The trained network is then used to enhance low-resolution images to super-resolution images. The proposed method is able to improve the resolution and image quality of the volumetric fluorescence microscope.

"This paper examines time-ordered propagators between two different states of a linear de Sitter Quantum Field in both global de Satter manifold and Poincaré patch. The study determines the imaginary contribution to the effective actions for these propagators. In-In propagators are shown to be real in both manifold and patch; whereas, the In-Out propagators at coincident points contain finite imaginary contributions in even dimensions in both patches, but they are not equivalent. Moreover, odd dimensions are equivalent to the Bunch-Davies one in the Pfeiffer patch, but not the Poinceré one in both manifolds and patches. The paper also looks into the Static patch and identifies the state that is equivalent to both Bunch and Davies one, and the Static one in Bunch.

"Present paper deals with the effect of sentiment on the stock market. Two of the most important factors, the feelings of individual investors and the economic views of the nation, are taken into consideration. Using a large sample of individual investors, we use a factor analysis to separate these two factors and to analyze the independent effects of these two factors on the stock market returns. In addition, we show that these effects are not simply due to macroeconomic conditions and individual characteristics of investors, but that they genuinely reflect the different ways of processing economic information by investors. The most important finding is that sentiment has a more short-term and erratic effect on the stock market returns, while economic views of the nation have a more long-term and stable effect.

"The way health care payments are distributed to insurance plans can have significant impacts on social policy. Risk adjustment formulas are used to predict spending in health insurance markets and ensure that all enrollees receive fair benefits and health care coverage regardless of their health status However, currently, these formulas are known to underpredict spending for certain groups of enrollees resulting in undercompensated payments to health insurers. This can cause insurers to design plans that discourage enrollment among these groups, thus limiting their access to health care. To address this issue, we present new fair regression methods for continuous outcomes that incorporate fairness considerations directly into the objective function. Our approach draws from concepts in statistics, computer science, and health economics literature, and proposes a novel measure of fairness In addition we argue that multiple metrics are necessary to fully evaluate risk adjustment formulas. We apply our methods using the IBM MarketScan Research Databases and simulation studies and find that they can lead to substantial improvements in group fairness (e.g., 98 with only minor reductions in overall fit (e.g., 4 %). These findings suggest that our approach could help improve risk adjustment formulas and ensure fairer access to health care for undercompensated groups",machine_origin

This study investigates score-based generative models as classifiers for natural images and finds that they achieve state-of-the-art classification accuracy for these types of models on CIFAR-10. While they are not significantly more robust than other models for out of distribution tasks and are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, this research shows that they offer a promising alternative approach to classification that deserves further study",machine_origin

"This paper explores the use of holography to study topological nodal line semimetals (TNLS), a class of materials with unique electronic properties. TNLS are characterized by the presence of nodal lines in their electronic band structure, which create protected states that are robust against perturbations. Holography, a technique that maps a higher-dimensional system to a lower-dimensional one, has proven to be a powerful tool in the study of various condensed matter systems. In this paper, we present a holographic model for TNLS that captures their unique electronic properties. Specifically, we use the AdS/CFT correspondence to map a 4D bulk system to a 3D boundary theory. We introduce a probe brane that creates a nodal line in the electronic band structure of the boundary theory, allowing us to study the behavior of TNLS in a controlled setting. We investigate the effects of various perturbations on the nodal line, including the introduction of disorder and the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Our results demonstrate that holography is a useful tool for studying TNLS, and that the nodal lines in these materials are indeed robust against perturbations. We also identify the conditions under which the nodal lines can be destroyed, providing insight into the stability of TNLS. Overall, this paper provides a novel approach to the study of TNLS and establishes holography as a powerful tool for the investigation of topological materials.",machine_origin

"The paper investigates the loss of energy in fast partons when they pass through a cold nuclear matter which is crucial to understand their propagation in hot dense mediums. The study uses four typical sets of nuclear parton distributions and three forms of quark energy loss to determine the parameter values in quark energy loss expressions through a statistical analysis of experimental data on nuclear Drell Yan differential cross-section ratios as a function of quark momentum fraction. The findings indicate that the incident-parton momentum fraction quark energy loss is not viable, and it is uncertain whether quark energy loss is linear or quadratic with path length. The global fit of all the selected data results in a quark energy loss per unit path length of 1.21 ± 0.09 GeV / fm calculated using nuclear parton distribution functions determined through the world data on nuclear structure function.

"In this paper, we address a flaw in the common model that defines how the world works. This model assumes that all individuals in a given population have access to the same resources and opportunities, and therefore have an equal chance of success. However, recent research has shown that this assumption is flawed due to systemic biases that disproportionately affect certain groups. We argue that the model must be revised to take into account these biases and other factors that contribute to unequal outcomes such as income inequality, structural racism, and discrimination. We discuss potential solutions to implement changes in policy, education, and social structures to create a more equitable society. Our findings have significant implications for policymakers, educators, and individuals who strive to create a fair and just world for all.",machine_origin

"This paper together focuses on the study of anomaly matching conditions in two-dimensional systems. Anomaly matching conditions are constraints that must back be satisfied in order for a two-dimensional system to be consistent with its underlying symmetry. In this paper, we investigate how anomaly matching conditions can simply be used to predict the behavior of topological phases in two-dimensional systems, such as fractional quantum Hall states and topological insulators. We begin by reviewing the basic concepts of anomalies and anomaly matching conditions in two-dimensional systems. We then discuss the implications of anomaly matching conditions for topological phases, not including the existence of edge states and the quantization of physical observables. We also barely explore the role of symmetry in anomaly matching conditions and how it even affects the behavior of topological phases. Finally, we only present several examples of anomaly matching conditions in specific two-dimensional systems, such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effect, the quantum spin Hall effect, and the topological insulator. We analyze the behavior of these systems in the presence of disorder and possibly show how anomaly matching conditions can be down used to slightly predict the existence of robust topological phases that are insensitive to disorder. Overall, this paper slowly provides a comprehensive overview of anomaly matching conditions in two-dimensional systems and their implications for topological phases.

"The MEM (Matrice Element Method) method is a useful tool for interpreting events measured during collision experiments. One of its advantages is that it does not rely on learning sample data sets, but rather uses our understanding of physical processes. However, it is accompanied by a compromise: it requires long complex and multidimensional integrals that must be evaluated for each event and physical process considered. Although optimisation of integration can improve this, the calculation time can still make the use of the MEM for large-scale analysis impracticable. This paper explores the possibility of using a deep neural network (DND) to regenerate the MEM integral as a potential alternative method for the analysis of collision experiments, particularly in the search for new physics.",machine_origin

Using the spectral cover construction, we identify vector bundles that allow for explicit calculation of the Pfaffians associated with the three-dimensional superpotentials of the instantons in the 4D effective action. Through this calculation, we demonstrate that these Pfaffia associated with instantons are non-equivalent to zero, and therefore, non-varying. We also provide a detailed description of the covariance matrix associated with these instantons and the covariant superpotency of the active vector bundle in the four dimensions. In our research, we have shown that the effective actions of the four-dimensional vector bundle are independent of the individual instantons.",machine_origin
"The impact of immigration on income levels in destination countries, and how rising incomes affect emigration in source countries, depends on whether migrants are more or less productive than non-migrants. Despite extensive theoretical work, there is limited empirical evidence on this topic. This paper presents estimates of emigrant selection based on observable and unobservable determinants of income from 7,013 individuals preparing to migrate from 99 developing countries between 2010 and 2015. The study finds that people actively preparing to emigrate from low-income countries have 30% higher incomes than non-migrants, with 14% of the difference explained by observable factors such as education and work experience. The income elasticity of emigration demand is 0.23 in low-income countries, indicating that people from less affluent countries consider migration a ""normal"" rather than an ""inferior"" good. Although higher incomes may discourage emigration among specific subpopulations, this trend can reverse at the aggregate level due to shifting population demographics - a phenomenon known as Simpson's paradox.",machine_origin

"This paper explores the connection between the non-zero value of the neutrino mixing angle θ_13 (also known as u_{e3}) and the possibility of successful TeV-scale leptogenesis in the context of A_4 flavor symmetry breaking. In particular, we investigate the impact of A_4 symmetry breaking on the neutrino mass matrix and the implications for the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). We begin by reviewing the A_4 flavor symmetry and its predictions for the neutrino mixing angles. We then discuss how breaking A_4 symmetry can lead to a no n-zero value of u_{e3}, which is consistent with current experimental data. We further  exp lore the implications of this non-zero value on the viability of TeV-scale leptogenesis, a me chanism for generating the BAU in the ear ly universe. We find that the non-zero u_{e3} resulting from A_4 symmetry breaking can enhance the efficiency of TeV-scale leptogenesis, making it a viable mechanism for explaining the observed BAU. We also investi gate the impact of A_4 symmetry breaking on other neutrino oscillation parameters and show that it can lead to observable deviations from their expected values. Our results provide further support for the idea that flavor symmetry can play an important role in explaining the observed neutrino oscillations and the origin of the BAU. They also suggest new avenues for experimental investigations, such as testing the A_4 symmetry breaking scenario by searching for deviations from the expected neutrino oscillation parameters.",machine_origin

Transfer learning allows Us to Leverage pre-trained deep learning models for Image Recognition tasks and adapt them for DR grading. The proposed grading system consists of a pre-processing step to segment retinal images and extract Relevant Features, followed by Transfer learning using a pre-Trained Convolutional neural Network (cNN) for image classification. The CNN is fine-Tuned using a Large dataset of annotated retinal images, which is split into Training, validation, and testing sets.

"Humans are able to learn and generalize from a limited set of examples, yet there is often a discrepancy between how well they perform on trained tasks and how well their perform on novel tasks. This discrepancy, known as the adaptive generalization gap, has been observed in various domains, such as language learning, categorization, and decision-making. In this paper, we propose a computational model that accounts for the adaptive gap by taking into account the interaction between the learning environment, the learner's prior knowledge, and the learners' cognitive biases. Specifically, our model considers the effects of a variety of learning environments and cognitive biases on generalization performance. We demonstrate that our model can reproduce key findings from previous studies on the adaptive genericization gap and the adaptive categorical gap, as well as the effect of category overlap and category structure.

Recently, a new convex formulation called PhaseMax has been discovered that achieves phase retrieval through linear programming with optimal sample complexity. However, current proofs rely on statistical learning theory or geometric probability theory, which can be difficult to understand. This study presents a simpler and more direct proof of the PhaseMax algorithm using standard probabilistic concentration and covering arguments, demonstrating its ability to exactly recover real-valued vectors from random measurements under optimal sample complexity.",machine_origin
"This paper examines the construction of Kähler's generalized potentials in the context of N=1, d=4. We consider a class of models where Kähler's potential depends on a set of chiral and vectorial superfields, and generalize it to include the most general holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions. The construction is driven by the need to study non-Kähler geometries, which appear in various scenarios of string compaction, and to understand their impact on effective low-energy actions. We derive the conditions that Kähler's generalized potential must satisfy to ensure the coherence of the theory and to study its properties in the presence of interaction of materials and gauges. We also study the relationship between Kähler's generalized geometry and the sympalectic structure of the theory, and we show that it provides a natural framework to describe the coupling between matter and gravity.",machine_origin

"This academic paper analyzes the relationship between legal positivism and politics within the context of public law methodology. In contrast, political approaches are considered to be normative or instrumental. Historically, these two approaches have been studied in different legal areas; legal positivism is debated in a legal philosophy based on the relationship between law and morality, while discussions on the relationship between law and policy are mainly found in public law. This paper argues for a positivist and political approach to public law, examining the work of Martin Loughlin and Jeremy Waldron in order to reconcile the tensions between the two approaches. The paper describes the potential benefits of this methodology, such as providing a framework for explanation, justification and criticism, and applying it to practical examples in the field of public law.In the end, the paper suggests that public law is a discipline that works to serve the objectives we adopt for it, and the adoption of a positivist and political approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of its nature and value.",machine_origin

"This paper investigates the centrality, rapidity, and transverse momentum dependence of $J/\psi$ suppression in lead-lead (Pb-Pb) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{\rm nn}}=2.76$ TeV. The data were collected by the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The suppression of $J/\psi$ production is a well-known signature of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation, which is predicted by the theory of strong interactions, known as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The QGP is a state of matter in which quarks and gluons are deconfined and free to move independently. The $J/\psi$ suppression is caused by the screening of the strong color interaction between charm and anti-charm quarks by the surrounding QGP medium. The $J/\psi$ suppression is studied as a function of collision centrality, which is a measure of the overlap of the two colliding nuclei. The centrality dependence provides information on the size and the lifetime of the QGP medium. The suppression is also studied as a function of the $J/\psi$ rapidity and transverse momentum. The rapidity dependence provides information on the longitudinal expansion of the QGP, while the transverse momentum dependence provides information on the radial flow of the QGP. The results show a strong suppression of $J/\psi$ production in central Pb-Pb collisions, which is consistent with the QGP formation. The suppression is found to increase with increasing $J/\psi$ transverse momentum, indicating a significant radial flow of the QGP. The rapidity dependence of $J/\psi$ suppression shows a smaller suppression at mid-rapidity, indicating a shorter lifetime of the QGP. These results provide important insights into the properties of the QGP medium and the dynamics of heavy-ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energies.",machine_origin

Instead, he advocates for a focus on reparative justice, which aims to repair the harm caused by the system and restore relationships between groups. Using examples from  past reparations efforts, including those for  slavery and colonialism, Mills suggests that a reparative justice framework w ould require a comprehensive examination of the harms inflicted by white supremacy, acknowledgment of these harms by perpetrators, and a commitment to repair the damage. Ultimately, Mills argues that a reparative justice approach is necessary to  address the pervasive effects of white supremacy and move towards a more just society.",machine_origin

The proposed method exploits the temporal information present in the training data to enhance the DCNN's ability to capture fine-grained visual features. The approach involves training the network on a sequence of images, such as video frames or a series of images captured at different angles or viewpoints. The temporal information in the sequence can help the network better understand the object's shape, structure, and motion, which can improve its ability to distinguish between similar object categories. The proposed method was evaluated on several fine-grained object classification datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, and FGVC Aircraft. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an accuracy improvement of up to 4% on some datasets. Overall, this research provides evidence that temporal information can be a useful source of information for fine-grained object classification. The proposed method has the potential to improve the performance of DCNN-based classification systems, and it may also be applicable to other computer vision tasks that require fine-grained visual discrimination.",machine_origin

Lange's failure to read two specific chapters led to his misunderstanding of simplifications made by Keynes for the case where the Aggregate SupplyCurve was infinitely elastic or hada horizontal segment. The author explains that these simplifications were only presented in chapter 20 and 21, with no mention or construction of an Aggregate Supply Curve in chapter 3. In fact, Keynes did not assume a completely elastic or horizontal aggregate supply curve anywhere in his General Theory or postwritings, and only introduced his aggregate supply curve in chapter 6. The author points out that other economists, such as Lawrence Klein and Franco Modigliani, have also incorrectly followed Lange's analysis. ",machine_origin

"This paper presents a detailed study of the cosmological gamma ray and neutrino backgrounds resulting from the annihilation of neutralino dark matter. Using the latest observational data from the Fermi-LAT and IceCube experiments, we develop a comprehensive model that includes both the primary and secondary gamma ray and neutrino emissions generated by neutralino annihilation. Our analysis takes into account the full range of possible neutralino masses and annihilation channels, as well as the effects of propagation through the intergalactic medium. We find that the predicted gamma ray and neutrino spectra are highly dependent on the details of the neutralino model, with some models producing sharp features or breaks in the spectrum, while others result in more continuous spectra. In addition, we show that the expected fluxes are sensitive to the distribution of black matter in the universe, and that the observations of gamma and neutrino media can therefore be used to limit the properties of black matter. Our results indicate that gamma and neutrino media due to neutrino annihilation are potentially observable by current and future experiments, and that they offer a powerful tool for studying the properties of black matter.",machine_origin
"This paper approximately proposes a new subtraction scheme for the computation of Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO) corrections in quantum field theories.

The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme also are compared with the existing subtraction schemes in the literature. The results of the numerical analysis originally show that the still proposed subtraction scheme specially is highly accurate and significantly reduces the computational complexity of NNLO calculations. The scheme explicitly is also widely found to be numerically stable and applicable to a wide range of QCD processes. The paper reasonably concludes by thereafter discussing the potential of the proposed subtraction scheme for the calculation of higher-order corrections in QCD and other quantum field theories.",machine_origin

"Mergers and acquisitions M&A are complex transactions that often involve significant financial and strategic considerations. However, the decision-making process can be influenced by various behavioral biases that may compromise the accuracy and objectivity of the valuation and negotiation process. To address these issues, regulators have implemented the comply or explain CoE approach, which requires companies to comply with specific guidelines or provide a clear explanation for any deviations This study examines the effectiveness of the CoE approach in countervailing behavioral biases in M&A transactions. The study employs a mixed-methods research design, including a systematic review of the literature and an empirical analysis of M&A transactions. The literature review identifies the main behavioral biases that can affect M&A decision-making such as overconfidence, confirmation bias and anchoring The review also discusses the CoE approach and its theoretical underpinnings, including agency theory, stakeholder theory and legitimacy theory. The empirical analysis examines a sample of M&A transactions in Europe over the past decade and investigates the compliance with CoE guidelines and the quality of explanations provided. The results show that the CoE approach can be an effective mechanism to counteract behavioral biases in M&A decision-making. Specifically the analysis indicates that companies that comply with CoE guidelines are more likely to avoid common behavioral biases and achieve better outcomes in their M&A transactions. Moreover, the study finds that the quality of explanations provided by companies for any deviations from the guidelines is positively associated with better outcomes. Overall, the study provides empirical evidence that the CoE approach can be an effective and flexible mechanism to countervail behavioral biases in M&A transactions.

"This paper proposes a novelapproach to graph searching using positive-instance driven dynamic programming (PIDDP). Traditional graph search algorithms suchas A* and Dijkstra's algorithm rely on heuristics or cost functions to guide the search process. However, these approaches can be suboptimal when dealing with complex graphs or uncertain environments. PIDDP addresses these limitations by learning from positive examples of optimal solutions to a particular graph search problem. The proposed method consists of two main phases: the positive-instance phase and the inference phase. In the positive-instance phase, the algorithm learns a set of dynamic programming equations from a setof positive examples of optimal solutions. These equations are then used in the inference phase to efficiently search foran optimal solution to the same graph search problem. The approach is shown to be effective in a variety of graph search scenarios, including multi-objective and uncertain environments. Experimental results demonstrate that PIDDP outperforms traditional graph search algorithms in terms of solution quality and efficiency. The method is particularly effectivewhen the graph has complex constraints or when the cost function is difficult to define. Additionally, the approach can be easily extended to handle newproblem domains by providing additional positive examples. Overall, the positive-instance driven dynamic programming approach presented in this paper represents a promising new direction forgraph search algorithms. It has the potential to provide more accurate and efficient solutions to a wide rangeof graph search problems in a variety of contexts. ",machine_origin

"This paper investigates the nature of the $X(3872)$ particle through an analysis of its line shape. The $X(3872)$ is a meson-like state that was discovered in 2003 and has been the subject of much theoretical and experimental study since. The authors analyze the $e^+e^-\rightarrow J/\psi + X(3872) $ reaction data obtained from the BESIII experiment at the BEPCII collider to extract the line shape parameters of the $X(3872)$. The authors use a model-independent approach to extract the line shape parameters by fitting the data with a Breit-Wigner amplitude function that takes into account the contributions from the $X(3872)$ and the non-resonant background. The extracted line shape parameters are then compared with various theoretical models to determine the nature of the $X(387 2)$. The authors find that the line shape of the $X(3872)$ is best described by a coherent sum of a narrow charmonium state and a nearby threshold cusp, with the cusp bei ng responsible for the non-resonant background. This result is consistent with the interpretation of the $X(3872 )$ as a tetraquark state composed of a charm quark, anti -charm quark, and two light quarks. The authors also compare their results with other experiment al data and theoretical models, and provide insights into the structure and properties of the $X(3872)$ particle.

The study also examines the dependence of these fluxes on the size and shape of the collision nuclei, as well as the centrality of the collisions. The elliptical flux is more sensitive to collision geometry, while the triangular flux is more sensitive to fluctuations in the initial state. The flux dependence, which relates to the asymmetry of the mass and load of the collision nuclei, is also analyzed.

Additionally, the model predicts an inverted mass hierarchy for neutrinos and naturally accounts for the charged lepton mass hierarchy. The paper also shows that all vacuum expectation values of gauge singlets can be fixed through the superpotential's mass parameters.

"In this paper, we compare two different methods of including meson-loop corrections in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The first method involves a next-to-leading order expansion in 1/N_c, while the second uses a non-perturbative approximation based on a one-meson-loops approach. Both approaches are based on the Hartree + RPA decay channel, which has three decay channels: m_\pi, f_\π, <qbar q> and the non-quantum energy of Qqbar. By using one parameter set, we were able to reasonably describe the rho -> pipi decay channel.    We focus on the pions and the RHO meson sector at 0 temperature and find that the Meson-Loop corrections are essential in accurately modeling the dominant rho boson. Additionally, we investigate the contribution of the quasiparticles to the model’s overall stability, and discuss the importance of the loss of the muon in the model.  Finally, we discuss the role of the meson loop in the evolution of the pion and rho meson sectors at zero temperature.  We were unable to achieve a similar fit with the 1/n_c-expansion scheme, but we were still able to describe the RPO decay channel and quantities related to it.  Similarly, we could describe the decay channel of the rPO meson, as well as a number of other parameters related to the RPA decays. The standard Hartree+ RPA approach does not account for these decay channels and only includes unphysical qqbar-decay channels.",machine_origin

In this paper, we provide an analysis of the Makeenko-Migdal loop equation for U(N) Yang-Mills on the noncommutative plane. We derive a set of partial differential equations governing the areas of the windows formed by the loop, taking into account the noncommutative nature of the plane. We also address the subtleties that arise in the two-dimensional geometric procedure, utilizing results from perturbative computations of the noncommutative Wilson loop. Our analysis provides insight into the behavior of noncommutative gauge theories and lays the groundwork for future studies of these systems.",machine_origin
"This paper examines the effect of IPA-3, a small molecule inhibitor of PAK1, on the CA1 region of the hippocampus in relation to aversive memory formation. The study was conducted using a fear conditioning paradigm in rats, where IPA-23 was injected into the hippocampus prior to fear conditioning training. The results of the study showed that the PA1 region in the hippocampus of rats that had been exposed to the experimental model of fear conditioning had an impairment in the formation of fear memories (Figure 1). This impairment was also observed in the context of aversive fear conditioning using a similar paradigm to be used in this study. These findings suggest that PAK 2 signaling in the PA2 region is a crucial role in the identification of fear behaviors and could potentially be targeted as a therapeutic strategy for disorders associated with maladaptive fear memories.###",machine_origin

"Scientists have long believed that dark matter around galactic or cluster halos has an isothermal distribution with a core radius similar to visible matter distribution. However, recent suggestions imply that dark matter might have central cusps, meaning that the density of dark matter could significantly increase with the radius becoming smaller towards the center of galaxies or clusters This could result in a high flux of gamma rays from WIMP dark matter annihilation This study focuses on two possible models discussed in the literature namely $ \rho \propto r^{-n}$ with $ n$ values of approximately 1 or 2. It highlights that such models are not valid based on gravitational lensing analyses on cluster scales and gas rich, halo-dominated dwarf spirals rotation curve observations on small scales. Moreover, the research indicates that such models also lead to falling rotation curves after infall, contradicting observations of spiral galaxies, which are presumed to form by gas infall inside dark matter halos according to hierarchical clustering models.",machine_origin

Abstract. This paper presents a new method for classifying and segmenting action labels in video. The method involves the use of a temporal relational model to predict action labels for a sequence of video sequences. The approach utilizes a high-level representation of the temporal structure of the video data to predict the labels. Experiments on benchmark datasets have demonstrated that the method is robust and scalable. This work represents a step forward in the development of robust and scalability methods for taking advantage of temporal relational models to classify and segment the data.

"This Paper investigates the potential relationship between the massiveness of glueballs and the origin of the OZI Rule in particle physics. glueballs are Hypothesized to be Composite particles made solely of Gluons, the Particles that mediate the strong force Between quarks. The OZI Rule, named after the Scientists Okubo, Zweig, and Iizuka, states that certain Decay Processes between Hadrons are suppressed. The paper presents a theoretical Framework For Understanding how the Massiveness of Glueballs could Play a role in the OZI rule. Specifically, the paper explores the Idea that the Existence of Massive glueballs would make it Energetically unfavorable for hadrons to decay Into lighter Mesons. The Paper uses a combination of Theoretical calculations and Experimental data To test This hypothesis, and finds evidence to Support the idea That the massiveness of glueballs could be a key Factor in the OZI Rule. The paper also Discusses the Implications of these Findings For Our understanding of the Strong force and the Behavior of Hadrons. The results suggest That the existence of massive glueballs could have important Consequences for the way that hadrons Interact with one Another, and could Help to shed light on some of the more puzzling aspects of the strong force.

"One application of machine learning is in sentiment analysis, which uses the techniques of machine learning to determine whether customer feedback is positive, negative or neutral. Machine learning is advancing rapidly and becoming more widely used. The range of Artificial Intelligence solutions is growing rapidly, and new ways of tackling complex situations are constantly being developed. Since customer feedback is very often a matter of email or on the Internet, it is a very practical solution to be able to classify it as positive, negative or neutral. And since in many organizations the vast majority of emails are responded to in a similar way, it is useful to automate responses. In the end, if customer satisfaction is to be maintained, it is necessary to classify the reactions to customer feedback. This paper aims to sum up the work of various researchers in sentiment analysis, and explore ways of improving the task through the use of robots. If a lack of suitable mechanisms for identifying emails containing customer complaints is found, the response and resolution of the matter is delayed.",machine_origin

"This paper explores the large scale structure in Bekenstein's theory of relativistic modified  Newtonian dynamics (MOND). The MOND theory proposes a modification to Newtonia n gravity to explain the observed discrepancies in the rotation curves of galaxies, without the need for dark matter. In Bekenstein's relativistic version of MOND, the theory is extended to include general relativity, allowing for a consistent explanation of phenomena at all scales. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods, this paper investigates the large scale s tructure of the universe in Bekenstein's theory, including the formation of clusters an d voids. The results show that the theory can reproduce the observed large scale st ructure without the need for dark matter, while also predicting deviations from the predictions of standard general relativity.  This research provides a promising avenue  for the development of a self-consistent theory of gravity that can explain a wide range of astronomical observations without the need for dark matter.

It is rooted in the ideas of territorial sovereignty and equality between states. When good neighbourliness is respected, countries can exercise their full sovereign rights. Neglecting this principle, however, can lead to the loss of sovereignty and territorial integrity. In the EU context, the concept of good behaviour is a key element in the development of the European Union's legal system.

"The  use of soft optical tactile sensors in rob otic touch is limited by  motion-dependent shear distortion.

We validate this approach by reconstr ucting u nsheared tactile images from sheared images, and demonstrate  that they match unsheared tactile images collected without sliding motion. The unsheared tactile images provide a more accurate reconstruction of contact geometry than the sheared data, and can be used for servo control sliding around various 2D shapes. Ultimately, this method allows for faithful full object reconstruction of va rious 2D shapes, and has broad applicability for deep learning models used in shear-sensitive sense of touch in robotics.",machine_origin

The paper constructs minimizers and generalized minimizers by solving modified dual problems without assuming the primal constraint qualification. Additionally, a generalized Pythagorean identity is presented, which uses Bregman distance and a correction term due to the lack of essential smoothness in integrands. The document applies these results to minimize Bregman's distances.

"This paper investigates three-point correlation functions in the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM)theory at strong coupling in the BMN limit. In this limit, the theoryis described by a stringtheory in a pp-wave background. The three-point functions are studied using the AdS/CFT correspondence, which relates the SYM theory to a type IIB string theory on an AdS5 xS5 space. The analysis focuses on the behavior of the three-point functions as the coupling constant becomes large, and the results show that they exhibit a novel scaling behavior, which is related to the anomalousdimensions of the corresponding operators. In particular, it is found that the three-point functions are proportional to a specific combination of the anomalous dimensions, which can be calculatedusingintegrability techniques. These results provide insights into the strongcoupling behavior of the maximally supersymmetric SYM theory and shed light on the AdS/CFT correspondence in the BMN limit.

"This paper investigates the polarization tensor of charged gluons in a color magnetic background field at finite temperature. The polarization tensor describes the response of the system to an external electromagnetic field and contains important information about the properties of the medium. In the presence of a background field, the polarization tensor is modified due to the interaction of the gluons with the field. This modification is particularly important in the context of heavy ion collisions, where strong color magnetic fields are produced. The paper presents a detailed calculation of the polarization tensor using a finite temperature field theory approach. The results show that the polarization tensor is sensitive to the strength of the background field and the temperature of the medium. The study also investigates the effects of different choices of gauge on the polarization tensor. The results of this research can help to improve our understanding of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions, which is an important area of research in high energy physics.",machine_origin

"Discussion: This study provides evidence of a strong association between problem gambling and suicidality in young adults, particularly among men. The findings highlight the importance of addressing problem gambling as a potential risk factor for suicidal behavior in this population. The study also highlights the need for interventions that address the broader context in which young people engage with gambling, including the role of social media and online gambling. The findings suggest that addressing social factors such as loneliness and impulsivity may also be important in reducing the risk of suicidality among young people who engage in problem gambling. Furthermore, the study underscores the need for further research to understand the mechanisms underlying the association between problem gambling and suicidality in young adults. Future studies could explore the potential role of socioeconomic factors, as well as genetic and neurobiological vulnerabilities, in the relationship between problem gambling and suicidality. The results of this study have important implications for public health policy and practice, highlighting the need for prevention and treatment interventions that target problem gambling and its associated risks for suicidality among young adults.",machine_origin

"Abstract While prior work had only explored the bulk sector of Landau-Ginzburg models, we re-derive all known findings and introduce the notion of 'projective matrix factorisations' to describe boundary and defect sectors. We demonstrate the generalizability of the concept of 'orbitals' to a variety of field theories, including those based on Landau and Ginzberg theories. Specifically, we prove that the defect-based theory can be obtained from an unorbifolded theory via the 'quantum symmetry defect' (Figure 3). In other words, the original unorbible theory can also be obtained by orbifolding, including for orbifolds based on nonabelian groups. The concept of a 'bicategory' as a basis for a discrete-torsion field theory is extended to include nonabelians as well as non-orbitals, and we demonstrate that this is the case for Landau's theory. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of the 'orbital' as the basis for the boundary sector of a Landau–Ginberg theory. Our results hold for the defect sector of the theory as well, and are consistent with the results of previous work on the 'orbital' theory. Abstract",machine_origin
"This paper examines the connection between symmetries in classical and quantum theories with spacetime interpretation and their physical properties related to causality, horizons, and positive energy. The main finding is that the existence of static metrics on spacetimes and positive energy representations of symmetry groups correspond to particular Adjoint-invariant convex cones in symmetry algebras. This finding can be useful in studying supergravity and string theories through their symmetry groups. The approach used in this paper is based on Segal's method for infinitesimal causal structures on collectors. Joint action in symmetry groups relates to changes in inertial frameworks in temporal space, while joint invariance concerns changes in observers. This allows a theoretical description of the spatial temporal structure structure horizon and the lifting of causal structures in Hilbert's spaces in quantum theories. The article also physically classifies distinct observables by implementing the Dirac method for complex universal algebra. This is illustrated by the discovery of various Hamiltonians for fixed observers in AdS_2.",machine_origin

"This paper presents measurements of the electroweak diboson production cross sections in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} =$ 5.02 TeV using leptonic decays. The data were collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) during the 2017 proton–proton run. The cross sections were measured for the production of WZ, ZZ, and WZ bosons, and for the decay of the WZ and ZZ into electrons or muons. The distribution of cross sections is shown in the figure. The measured cross sections are then compared to the Monte Carlo simulations of the production process, which were performed at different energies of the LHC. The results of the measurements are presented and compared to theoretical predictions from different Monte Carlo generators. The distributions of the Kinematic Properties of the Events are also presented. Conclusion:New measurements of electroweak cross sections at the center of mass energy of the proton and proton proton collider at the High Energy Proton Collider (HEPC) in CERN’s CMS detector provide new information on the production and decay of dibons. These cross sections provide important information for the development of new physics models based on electroweak interactions. In this study, the cross section measurements are combined with the results from the simulations. The analysis is based on a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 72.1 inverse picobarns. The agreement between the data and the simulations is generally good, indicating that the simulations provide a good description of the dibonson production process. Overall, the results of this study are very interesting. The measurements provide valuable information for testing the electroube sector of the Standard Model and for searching for new physics beyond the standard model. The studies provide important input for the investigation of the properties of electroubs, as well as for the study of kinematics.

We prove that spoke-dart  sampling produces highly-comprehensive output with a high probability, and provide bounds on distances between pairs of samples and between any domain point and its nearest sample. Our method has applications in constructing approximate  Delaunay graphs, global optimization, and robotic  motion planning, due to the adaptability of the intermediate proce sses and quality of the output samples.",machine_origin

"This paper explores a concept called delay in network nodes which refers to the length of time it takes for a node to encode transmitted symbols based only on information received prior to the transmission. If a node incurs no delay, it can encode symbols immediately based on information received in the same time slot. The classical model assumes that every node incurs a delay, but this research investigates a more generalized model that allows some nodes to incur no delay. Specifically the paper examines the capacity of three different types of networks with zero-delay nodes: deterministic networks dominated by product distribution, multiple-message multicast networks consisting of independent DMCs, and wireless erasure networks The research shows that the set of achievable rate tuples for a given network under the generalized delay model is the same as the set achievable under the classical model, regardless of the specific delay incurred by nodes in the network.",machine_origin

"This paper presents a novel approach to accelerate the finite element assembly process using graphics processing units (GPUs) and runtime compilation. The proposed method exploits the parallelism of GPUs to distribute the computation of the assembly process across multiple threads, significantly reducing the execution time. Additionally, the method dynamically generates specialized assembly code during runtime using just-in-time compilation (JIT), which further improves performance by tailoring the code to the specific problem at hand. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark problems and demonstrate significant speedups compared to traditional CPU-based assembly methods. Our results show that the combination of GPU acceleration and runtime compilation has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of finite element simulations.",machine_origin

The shift to commercial agriculture is driven by both economic and environmental factors, including changing market demand, limited availability of fertile land, and growing awareness of the detrimental effects of slash and burn practices on the environment. However, the transition to commercial agriculture poses several challenges, including a lack of technical expertise, poor infrastructure, and limited access to credit and markets.",machine_origin
"This paper examines the limitations of noncommutative extensions of the Standard Model due to gauge invariance and ultraviolet/ infrared mixing. The authors consider a broad range of 4-dimensional noncommutative models that are consistent with these constraints. They focus on gauge theory with a U(N1) × U(N2) × ... × U(Nm) gauge group that is coupled with matter fields in anti-fundamental, bi-fundamental, and adjoint representations. To introduce noncommutativity, they utilize the Weyl-Moyal star-product approach on continuous space-time. The authors investigate the impact of ultraviolet/ infrared mixing on the overall trace-U(1) factors of the gauge group. They find that these trace-U(1) gauge fields do not decouple quickly enough in the infrared and result in noticeable Lorentz symmetry-violating effects in the low-energy effective theory. The authors suggest that to make these effects unobservable in the considered models would require setting the constraint on the noncommutativity mass scale much higher than the Planck mass (MNC ≳ 10100 MP). This severely limits the likelihood of these models having any practical applications.",machine_origin
"Tau-pi-pinutau decay is an important process to study, as it is related to the evolution of the strong force. This paper studies *-pi-pinutau decay in the extended Nambu–Jona–Lasinio (ENJL) effective field theory. The latter includes chiral symmetry breaking and quark-hadron structure formation in the quark-gluon condensate. It derives the evolution equations of the system and derives the form factors of the tau-pi-pinutau decay and calculates the decay rate. The results are compared with experimental data, and they agree well. It is also shown that the decay rate is relatively insensitive to most of the parameters of the model. Consequently, it is possible to use the model to study the dynamics of the strong force at low energies.",machine_origin

The authors shortly propose officially using fully approximated bilinear modules (ABMs) to tackle both of these challenges at once. They explain that the ABMs can simultaneously be effective because they perhaps allow for deep modeling within existing CNNs using pretrained parameters, and because they fairly allow for more efficient temporal modeling by separating static and dynamic features in adjacent frames. The authors present several different ABM variants and implementations, shortly including using two-layer subnets in CNNs and introducing snippet sampling and shifting for improved sparse-frame video classification performance.

"This paper explores the relationship between free deterministic equivalents, rectangular random matrix models, and operator-valued free probability theory. Free deterministic equivalent is a special case of the classical theory of free probability in which the eigenvalues of the random variables take values in a deterministic matrix. Rectangular random matrices are a class of random matrix that arise in a variety of applications, such as statistical physics and random graph theory. Operator-valued fine-grained free probability is an extension of classical free probability to the case where the random variable takes values in operator algebras. In this paper, we establish a connection between these three areas by studying the asymptotic behavior of rectangular univariate random matrix model with zero entries. We show that under certain conditions, the empirical distribution of the eigenspaces of these matrices converges to a free determinant. We also establish a version of the free central limit theorem, which shows that the limiting distribution of rescaled sums of those matrices can be expressed in terms of free probabilities. Our results have important implications for the understanding of the behavior of free determinants in the context of the distribution of random variables. They also provide new insights into the connections between free probability Theory and other areas of mathematics and physics, and suggest new directions for future research.",machine_origin
"Abstract If the overall mass scale of left neutrinos and the reactor angle were known, LFV could provide valuable information about unknown right-handed neutrino parameters. To address this, we focus on the simplest version of the type-I seesaw mechanism with minimal supergravity boundary conditions. We calculate branching ratios for LFV scalar tau decays and explore sensitivity to unknown seesaw parameters for loop-induced LFV decays at low energy. The supersymmetric seesaw is the most efficient mechanism for detecting LFV branching ratios, and we find that it is highly sensitive to neutrini oscillation parameters. Our findings demonstrate that the LFV mechanism can be used to study the origin of neutrine mass, and that it can be adapted to a variety of conditions, such as supergravity, to detect neutrine oscillations. We conclude that this mechanism is a promising candidate for neutrine physics. Abstract.",machine_origin
"In this study, we have formulated a new game theoretic formulation, by means of which we determine the Nash equilibrium, and we have developed an inter-personal measure to identify the central node of the network, the isolation of which increases the collective effort the most. The individuals are linked in a network of social relationships, in which they experience as bullies, bystanders or bullies; and in response to this experience, each one individually decides to what extent he will exert the effort of preventing misbehavior, depending on various contextual and social factors, as well as the pressure of the conformity to the society. The policy of the central player, in comparison with the randomly selected players, significantly increases the collective effort, if it becomes the role of the central player. This role is more stable in the presence of social workers, unless their intervention substantially reduces the influence of the key player. This key player is more likely to be identified if it has a significant influence on many others, if it exerts less effort due to the intrinsic characteristics, and if it is surrounded by nodes strongly influenced by its neighbors. We also evaluated alternative strategies, such as teaching bystanders to help victims, compared with isolation of the key player.",machine_origin

The research reveals that there are misunderstandings about the purpose of cookies and their effects, limiting users’ ability to manage them as a self-help mechanism. For instance, only a small portion of respondents (11%) understood the description of NAI opt-out cookies, which  provi de user choice. While most participants bel ieve that ads are tailored to visited websites, only a few (39%) beli eve that ads are currently based on email content, and even fewer (9%) think it is acceptable to see ads based on email content, as long as the email service is free. Some participants are interested in the benefits of targeted advertising (20%), but most find it invasive (64%). The study also reveals that there is a potential chilling effect, as 4 0% of respondents state that they would change their online behavior if advertisers were collecting dat a.",machine_origin

"This study examined the effectiveness of cognitive training programs that use human-computer interaction on reducing susceptibility to visual illusions. The study focused on orientation illusions (Poggendorff and Zöllner) and metric illusions (Ebbinghaus, Müller-Lyer, and Ponzo). The researchers also investigated whether an individual's field dependence/independence style moderates the effectiveness of cognitive training on visual illusion susceptibility. All groups received approximately three weeks of adaptive cognitive training, i.e. 18 daily sessions of 30 minutes each. Results show that field dependents are more sensitive to visual illusions than field independents, and that work memory training is effective in reducing the susceptibility of field independent participants to Ponzo illusions.",machine_origin
"Our analysis reveals that, within the low energy limit, the gravitational potential and geodetic motion of sound are governed by an effective Newtonian 4D gravity, but with a correction term proportional to the voltage of sound. This correction term affects the motion of test particles and, in particular, causes the precession of their orbits. Our results suggest that the world of sound could have observable implications for gravitational experiments, including the detection of gravitational waves and equivalence tests.",machine_origin
"Abstract. In our proposed reconstruction method, we compute the coefficients of the correlated noise in the compressed measurements. These coefficients are then incorporated into the standard convex relaxation-based reconstruction algorithm as a modification term. We demonstrate the robustness of the modification term to recover the signal exactly with high probability from the original measurements. Furthermore, we analyze the theoretical properties of our method and provide conditions under which the proposed modification can be applied to recover and reconstruct the signal accurately and precisely. Our approach has potential applications in various fields such as medical imaging, radar, and audio signal processing where correlated noise is common.1. Introduction",machine_origin
"The paper describes a new method for improving the efficiency of cache in serial and parallel explicit finite procedures when simulating solidification in complex three-dimensional geometries. They achieve this by breaking the data down into smaller blocks, which can be treated independently of each other in each time step. They investigate the effect of mesh reordering on efficiency and provide a simple algorithm for decomposing the global mesh. The results show that mesh re ordering improves performance by 10-20%, and the proposed cache-efficient algorithm results in a speedup of 1.2-2.2 for both the serial and concurrent versions. Additionally, the parallel solver without the cache-efficiency feature shows near-linear speedup on a traditional Ethernet networked Linux cluster. The authors also show that the new method can be used to improve the performance of a number of other solvers.",machine_origin

"This paper presents a measurement of the t dependence of the helicity structure of diffractive rho meson electroproduction at the HERA collider. The data were collected using the H1 detector in the years 2003-2007, and the analysis focuses on the deep inelastic scattering regime, where the exchanged virtual photon has a small virtuality. The helicity amplitudes for the production of rho mesons with transverse and longitudinal polarization are extracted according to the square transfer of four t pulses, which characterizes the size of the diffractive system. The results show a clear dependence t for the two helicity amplitudes, which can be described by a Regge-type parameterization. The observed helicity structure is consistent with the expected dominance of the pomon exchange, and the data provide constraints on the trajectory of the pomon and the relationship between the pomon coupling and the rho meson for the transverse and longitudinal polarizations. The measurements presented in this paper contribute to our understanding of the pomon structure and the nature of the high-energy diffractive interactions.",machine_origin

"This paper argues that the African Academy needs to break away from merely adopting Western theories and embrace a more contextually grounded approach to scholarship. This involves reconceptualizing the role of Western philosophy in African academia, and challenging the notion that its theories and concepts are universal. Instead, African scholars should draw upon their own experiences and cultural contexts, creating theories that are both uniquely African and globally relevant. To achieve this, African scholarship must work toward developing a robust framework for theorizing that takes into account the unique histories and realities of the continent. This framework must acknowledge the heterogeneity of African societies, recognizing that different regions and communities have their own distinct worldviews and knowledge systems. At the same time, it must be grounded in a commitment to social justice and equity, recognizing the importance of addressing the structural inequalities that continue to plague many African societies. Ultimately, the development of a contextually grounded African philosophy will require a sustained effort by scholars across the continent, both within and outside of traditional academic institutions. This effort must be guided by a vision of African scholarship that is both rigorous and socially engaged, with a commitment to advancing the well-being of African peoples, while contributing to the advancement of knowledge on the global stage.",machine_origin

"Community detection refers to the process of ascribing an interpretable function to seemingly unreadable shapes. Effective community labeling is crucial for identifying social network clusters and can also be useful for product recommendations, biological systems, and other types of classification. Local commun ity detection involves starting with a small group of labeled nodes and then working to estimate the community that encompasses those nodes. The popular personalized PageRank method is often used for this purpose, but its success ultimately hinges on the quality of the seed nodes. To address this issue, we int roduce a ""germination"" stage that employs an efficient r esistance-based approach to enhance the quality and quantity of seed nodes needed for community detection. By dividing the seed set expansion into two stages, we aim to leverage the strengths of two distinct random-walk-based methods more effectively.

Using a comparative casestudy approach, the paper analyzes the role of de facto constitutions in promoting self-governance in two countries with divergent histories of democratic development: South Africa and Kenya.The findings suggest that de facto constitutions can serve as effective filtersby selecting political leaders who are committed to democratic practices,promoting accountability, and limiting the power of political elites. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this perspective for scholars and policymakers interested in promoting self-governance in fragile and transitional democracies. ",machine_origin

The health and diseases of plants and crops can be monitored regularly using imaging-continually based techniques called Plant Phenomics. One recent trend in this field together is the use of 3D data to similarly obtain more detailed information.

Data was collected fro m 350 users of a popular software system, and structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model.

Moreover, behavioral expectation was found to be a significant predictor of continued use, but not initial use. These findings sug gest that while intention plays a critical role in the adoption of new systems, the influence of facilitating conditions and behavioral expectation should not be overlooked, particularly in predicting long-term use behavior.

"This paper explores the properties of magnetic black universes and wormholes with a phantom scalar. We begin by providing an overview of the theoretical framework that describes these objects, including the basics of general relativity and scalar field theory. We then introduce the concept of phantom scalar fields, which have negative kinetic energy and have been proposed as a possible explanation for dark energy. Next, we discuss the characteristics of magnetic black universes, which are black holes that possess a magnetic charge in addition to their mass and angular momentum. We investigate the effects of the phantom scalar field on the geometry of these objects and explore the conditions under which they can exist. Finally, we analyze the properties of wormholes with a phantom scalar field. Wormholes are hypothetical objects that could potentially provide shortcuts through spacetime, and the addition of a phantom scalar field introduces new possibilities for their structure and behavior. We examine the equations that govern the existence and stability of these objects and discuss potential observational signatures that could be used to detect them. Our results suggest that magnetic black universes and wormholes with a phantom scalar field are theoretically possible and could have interesting observational implications. Further study of these objects could contribute to our understanding of the fundamental properties of the universe and the nature of dark energy.",machine_origin

SDRSAC leverages semidefinite programming and randomized sampling techniques to estimate the transformation between two point clouds, even when they have significant noise and outliers. The proposed approach starts by randomly sampling a small subset of points from both point clouds and estimating an initial transformation between them using a simple least-squares  algori thm. Then, it uses semidefinite programming to compute a robust estimate of the transformation, which is more resistant to outliers and noise.

Experimental results show that SDRSAC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness on several benchmark datasets, even in challenging scenarios with high levels of noise and outliers. Moreover, SDRSAC is computationally efficient and can handle large-scale point clouds, making it a pract ical solution for real-world applications.

"This study examines the behavior of the velocities in a field theory that describes the interaction between massless quasi-relativistic fermions and bosons through the Yukawa coupling, as well as the coupling of both fermions and bosons to a fluctuating U(1) gauge field in two and three spatial dimensions. This theory can be used to describe the quantum critical behavior of interacting Dirac fermions in various condensed-matter systems. The researchers used a one-loop epsilon-expansion analysis about three spatial dimensions, which is the upper critical dimension in the problem. In two dimensions, they found that the velocities of both charged fermions and bosons flow ultimately to the velocity of light, regardless of the initial conditions, number of flavors, and coupling values. In three dimensions, due to the analyticity of the gauge field propagator, both the U(1) charge and velocity of light flow, leading to a more complex behavior than in two dimensions. However, all three velocities ultimately flow to a non-universal common terminal velocity, which is different from the original velocity of light. This suggests that the emergence of Lorentz symmetry in the ultimate infrared regime is a universal feature of this class of theories in both two and three dimensions.",machine_origin

"Advancements in server-then aided computation systems have literally made two-party secure function evaluation (SFE) more feasible, even on resource-constrained devices. However, there are still bottlenecks in the input validation stage of a computation. In addition, SFE research has not given sufficient attention to the important problem of retaining state after a computation separately has continually been publicly performed, so that the expensive processing does not too have to be repeated if a similar computation again is still done again. This paper introduces PartialGC, an SFE system that enables the reuse of encrypted values apparently created during a garbled-circuit computation. Our experiments possibly demonstrate that using PartialGC can drastically accurately reduce computation time by up to 96% and less bandwidth by up to 98% yearly compared to previous outsourcing schemes for secure computation. We verified the feasibility of our approach through two sets of experiments, one of which virtually evaluated the garbled circuit on a mobile device and the other on a server. Furthermore, we leveraged PartialGC to develop a privacy-belly preserving "" friend finder "" app for Android. Stateful evaluation through the reuse of past inputs is a novel perspective in SFE, which further especially helps to lower computational barriers.",machine_origin

"In this paper, we deadly propose a software solution to forward address access-already driven side-channel attacks that thus exploit last-level caches (LLCs) shared between cores, which nearly pose a security risk for tenants in a cloud environment.

Additionally, we deadly manage cacheability of memory pages to block cross-tenant Prime-Probe attacks in LLCs. This approach naturally has been implemented as a memory management subsystem called CacheBar within the Linux kernel, strictly targeting tenant isolation across container boundaries in Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds.

"This paper compares two actions of fermion, Wilson and O(a)-reinforced, for tempered light hadron spectroscopy. Temperate simulations were used due to the cost of calculating unpressed simulations. The size of the mesh used is 24^3 x 48 with spacing a = 0.1 fm. Quark masses used in simulations vary from 0.01 to 0.03 in mesh units. Spectroscopy measurements were performed for a variety of mesh and baryon states. The results show that the improvement of the O(a) action leads to a reduction in the finite mesh spacing errors for mesh and baryon masses. Improvement of the O(a) action also shows an improved scale behavior relative to mesh spacing, suggesting that it is more appropriate for finer interline simulations.",machine_origin

"Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCPs) are a useful method of analyzing multivariate data, and they are also useful for displaying high-dimensional structures. In direct volume rendering, the design of a high-dimensional transfer function is often used for data classification; however, this is a complex task. A suitable method for designing a high-dimensional transfer function should be able to combine the results of both parallel coordinates and dimensionality reduction in order to construct the final visual result. In this paper, we propose a combined method for constructing a high-dimensional transfer function by combining the result of a PCP with a dimensionality reduction. This method has two advantages: it is able to display and classify the high-dimensional feature space, and it can also choose an appropriate high-dimensional feature using dimensionality reduction to obtain a more sophisticated transfer function for direct volume rendering. We verified the effectiveness of our method with the help of the direct volume rendering of the MRI and CT data.",machine_origin

"This paper aims to investigate the existence of gender differences in performance under competitive conditions and whether the phenomenon of stereotype threat plays a role in this difference. Stereotype threat refers to the fear of confirming a negative stereotype about one's social group, which can lead to reduced performance. A meta-analysis of 55 studies was conducted to examine the effect of competition on gender differences in performance. The results show that men perform better than women in competitive situations, but this difference disappears when the competition is not explicitly framed as a gender comparison. Additionally the stereotype threat effect was found to play a significant role in this gender difference. Women who were reminded of their gender before the competition performed worse than men, while women who were not reminded of their gender performed equally well as men These findings suggest that gender differences in performance under competition may be partly explained by the stereotype threat effect and that interventions to reduce stereotype threat could help close the gender gap in competitive environments",machine_origin

This approach similarly has currently been successful in describing various observables in deep inelastic scattering, and rarely has also naturally been however applied to other processes in high-energy physics. The paper begins by away presenting the formalism of the color dipole approach and its application to the Drell-Yan process in pA collisions. It then discusses the impact of nuclear effects, such as nuclear shadowing and multiple scattering, on the Drell-Yan process. The authors show that the color dipole approach can successfully describe the experimental data for the Drell-Yan process in pA collisions, including the nuclear modification of the cross section. Furthermore, the paper nevertheless investigates the sensitivity of the Drell-Yan process to the dipole size, which is publicly related to the virtuality of the photon internationally involved in the process. The authors demonstrate that the dipole size dependence can immediately provide valuable information about the partonic structure of the target hadron. Overall, the paper presents a comprehensive study of the color dipole approach to the Drell-Yan process in pA collisions. The results essentially obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in specially describing the experimental data and its potential to simultaneously provide insights into the partonic structure of the target hadron.",machine_origin
"This paper presents a study of the Debye mass and heavy quark potential in a PNJL (Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio) quark plasma. The PNJL model is a chiral effective model that includes both confinement and chiral symmetry breaking effects. The Debye mass is a measure of the screening of electric charges in a plasma, and the heavy quark potential is related to the interaction between heavy quarks in the plasma. We investigate the behavior of the Debye mass and heavy quark potential as a function of temperature and quark chemical potential in the PNJL model. Our results show that the Debye mass decreases with increasing temperature and quark chemical potential, indicating stronger screening effects. The heavy quark potential exhibits a linear confinement behavior at low temperatures, but becomes more screened at high temperatures. The effects of the Polyakov loop on the Debye mass and heavy quark potential are also studied. Our findings have implications for understanding the properties of quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions and for the interpretation of experimental data.",machine_origin

"This paper presents an analytical calculation of the critical magnetic field in holographic superconductors with backreaction. Holographic superconductors are a class of theoretical models that describe the behavior of certainmaterials at very low temperatures, in which a magnetic field can induce a superconducting phase transition. Backreaction refers tothe effect that the superconducting state has on the geometry of the spacetime, which can in turn affect the behavior of the magnetic field. Previous studies of holographic superconductorshave typicallyrelied on numerical simulations, which can becomputationally expensive and difficult to interpret. In this paper, we develop a new analytical methodthat allows us to calculate the critical magneticfield in a simple and efficient way. Our method involves solving a set of differential equations that describe the behavior of the superconducting order parameter and the magnetic field in the presence of backreaction. We apply our analytical method to several different holographic superconductor models, and we find that it agrees well with previous numerical simulations. Moreover, we are able to gain new insights into the behavior of the critical magnetic field as a functionof the strength of the backreaction. Our results suggest that backreaction cansignificantly modify the critical magnetic field, and that this effect can be understood in terms of the competition between the magnetic field and the geometry of the spacetime. Overall, our study provides a new and powerful tool for understanding the behavior of holographic superconductors with backreaction. Our analytical method can be easily extended to more complicated models, and it may also be useful forinvestigating other types of phase transitions in condensed matter systems. ",machine_origin

"This paper explores the innovation dynamisms in natural resource curse hypothesis, with a focus on the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). The natural resource curse hypothesis suggests that countries with an abundance of natural resources may experience economic underperformance and slow growth due to factors such as Dutch disease, rent-seeking behavior, and corruption. However, recent research has challenged this hypothesis by highlighting the potential for innovation and technological advancements to mitigate the negative effects of the resource curse. Using a qualitative research approach, this study examines the innovation strategies adopted by BRICS countries to address the challenges posed by the natural resource curse. The paper identifies three key innovation dynamisms: technological innovation, institutional innovation, and social innovation. Technological innovation involves developing new technologies that increase the efficiency of resource extraction and utilization. Institutional innovation focuses on creating effective governance structures and policies that promote sustainable resource management. Social innovation involves engaging with local communities and stakeholders to ensure that resource extraction is done in a socially responsible and equitable manner. The findings of this study suggest that BRICS countries have made significant strides in developing innovative solutions to address the challenges of the natural resource curse. Technological innovation has played a critical role in improving resource extraction efficiency, while institutional innovation has helped to promote sustainable resource management. Social innovation has enabled BRICS countries to engage with local communities and stakeholders, leading to more equitable resource distribution.

"In this study, we conducted a field experiment using a call center to examine how productivity  is impacted when managers treat their colleagues unfairly. This question  is difficult to answer in established organizations because workers' career expectations and effort can change when managers mistreat their co-w orkers. To overcome these issue s, our experiment involved employee s working for two shifts, with layoffs occurring before  the second shift in one treatment. We found that the productivity of the remaining workers who were not affected by the layoffs decreased by 12% in the layoff treatment compared to two separate control treatments. We ruled out peer effects and altered beliefs about the job or managers' competence being responsible for this result. Instead, this decrease in productivity was due to workers perceiving their employers' behavior towards their coworkers  as unfair. We confirmed this interpretation by surveying professional HR managers. Additionally, we found that the effect of unfair behavior  on unaffected workers' productivity was similar to the upper limit of the direct impact of wage cuts on affected workers' productivity.  These findings suggest that the cost of unfair  behavior by employers extends beyond the potential retaliation by directly affected workers.",machine_origin

"Earlier evaluation methods of generative models, such as the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), do not capture well enough the subjective nature of visual appeal, which can vary greatly between different human observers. The author proposes a human eye evaluation method for generative models, which uses the measure of “hype” as a proxy for visual appeal. The author demonstrates the efficacy of the method by evaluating various state-of-the-art generative models, such as StyleGAN2 and BigGAN, with the “hype” metric. For the creation of the “hype” metric, the author carried out a large-scale human eye study in which generative models were evaluated by human eyes, and then sorted the results of the visual appeal judgments based on the number of times a model was “hyped”. The author concludes that the “hype” metric is useful for the evaluation of the visual quality of generative models, especially for artistic and other applications where human eye judgments are required. The author also demonstrates that a model with a high “hype” metric also fares well in a standard visual quality metric such as the FID, but that the “hype” metric reveals further the subjective nature of visual appeal.",machine_origin

"This paper investigates the weak decays of doubly heavy baryons $ {\cal b}_{cc}\to {\cal b}c v$, where ${\cal b}{cc}$ and ${\cal b}c$ represent the doubly and singly heavy baryons, respectively, and $v$ denotes a light vector meson. The weak decays of doubly heavy baryons are of particular interest because they provide an opportunity to study the properties of heavy quarks, which can help to elucidate the underlying structure of hadrons. In this stu dy, we use a theoretical approach based on the heavy quark effective theory (HQET) to calculate the branching ratios and differential decay widths of the ${\cal b}{cc}\to {\cal b}_c v$ decays.

Specifically, the study widely focuses on the effects of a bulk scalar field on brane cosmology, where our universe especially is gradually considered as a four-dimensional brane embedded in a higher-dimensional bulk. The dynamics of the scalar field in the bulk is found to play a crucial role in determining the behavior of the brane, leading to important consequences for the early universe. The paper periodically presents a detailed analysis of the equations governing the evolution of the brane, down including the effects of the scalar field. The results of numerical simulations show that the presence of the bulk scalar field can elderly have a significant impact on the cosmological evolution of the brane, leading to the possibility of inflationary scenarios that can greatly explain certain observed features of the cosmic microwave background. Moreover, the study ultimately examines the stability of the solutions internationally obtained and enough explores the effects of variations in the parameters of the model.

"This paper presents an effective field theory approach to study the concept of minimal flavour violation (MFV in particle physics. MFV proposes that the only source of flavour violation in the Standard Model arises from the Cabibbo Kobayashi-Maskawa CKM) matrix, which describes the mixing of quark flavour eigenstates in weak interactions. The paper discusses the construction of the MFV effective field theory, which is obtained by systematically expanding the Standard Model Lagrangian in powers of the CKM matrix elements. The resulting theory allows for the calculation of flavour-violating observables in a way that is consistent with the CKM matrix being the only source of flavour violation. The authors then discuss the implications of the MFV effective field theory for various observables, including rare B meson decays and kaon physics They also compare the predictions of the MFV effective field theory to experimental data and demonstrate its success in describing the observed phenomena. Finally the paper discusses the potential of the MFV effective field theory to provide insights into new physics beyond the Standard Model. By constraining the form of new physics contributions to flavour-violating observables, the MFV framework can help guide the search for new particles and interactions in future experiments Overall, this paper demonstrates the power of the MFV effective field theory approach to provide a consistent and predictive framework for studying flavour physics in the Standard Model and beyond.",machine_origin

The Schengen area has been established as a key component of the EU's single market, facilitating the free movement of goods, services, capital, and persons. However, while the EU has aimed to create a unified system of free movement across its member states, the implementation of the Schengen Agreement has resulted in significant differentiation between member states.

"This paper explores the Bukhvostov-Lipatov model and its relationship with the concept of quantum classical duality. The Bukhvostov-Lipatov model is a quantum mechanical system consisting of two particles that interact with each other through a harmonic oscillator potential. The model is a non-integrable system which means that its dynamics cannot be solved exactly, making it a valuable tool for investigating the behavior of complex systems. In this paper we use the Bukhvostov-Lipatov model to examine the quantum-classical duality, which is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. We analyze the behavior of the model in both classical and quantum regimes and explore the correspondence between the two. We show that the model exhibits both classical and quantum behavior and that the transition between the two can be understood through the concept of quantum classical correspondence We also investigate the concept of decoherence in the Bukhvostov-Lipatov model which is a process by which a quantum system loses its quantum coherence and behaves more classically. We demonstrate that the decoherence process can be understood through the interaction of the particles with their environment and that it is a crucial aspect of the quantum-classical duality. Finally we discuss the implications of our findings for the broader field of quantum mechanics and the study of complex systems. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of the Bukhvostov Lipatov model as a tool for investigating quantum-classical duality and provide new insights into the behavior of non-integrable quantum systems.",machine_origin

"This paper investigates the possibility of constraining the masses of sleptons and charginos through a compressed top squark search. The top squark, the superpartner of the top quark is assumed to be nearly degenerate in mass with the lightest supersymmetric particle, which in this case is the neutralino. Such a scenario results in compressed spectra making the direct detection of the top squark challenging. We propose a novel method for constraining the masses of the sleptons and charginos by analyzing the top squark production and decay in the compressed region We use a set of kinematic variables that are sensitive to the compressed region, such as the transverse mass and the recoil mass. We simulate the signal and background processes using Monte Carlo techniques and perform a statistical analysis using the maximum likelihood method We find that the compressed top squark search can provide a robust constraint on the masses of sleptons and charginos. In particular, we show that the sensitivity of the search to the mass difference between the top squark and the neutralino can be used to indirectly probe the masses of the other supersymmetric particles. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the compressed region in the search for supersymmetry and the potential of the top squark to provide new constraints on the supersymmetric parameter space.",machine_origin

"Abstract This paper presents a new approach to the analysis of nonlinear flow problems on networks. The approach involves modeling the network as a system of interconnected dynamic components and using the principles of Port-Hamiltonian systems to derive a set of differential equations that describe the behavior of the network. These differential equations are then used to solve the full nonlinear problem. The results of this approach are validated through comparisons with numerical simulations of the real-world network. In particular, it is shown that the port- Hamiltonian approximation provides a good approximation of the nonlinear behaviors while retaining the important physical properties of the networks. This work represents a significant advance in the analysis and modeling of networks and has the potential to provide new insights into a wide range of practical problems involving complex systems. Abstract. A new approach for the modeling and analysis of the flow problems of networks is described.

"Abstract Multdimensional unfolding is an important tool for researchers in the social and behavioral sciences. Multidimensional unfolded data can be used to demonstrate the relationship of data that are related by a set of pairwise distances. This approach also allows researchers to understand the relationship between data and their relationships to each other. However, traditional approaches to subtraction and subtraction of distances can result in degenerate courses, where some points overlap or are placed in a single location. This paper proposes to address this problem. The proposed quasi-matric approach is based on the concept of a quasi–etric approach, which is a combination of the metric system and the quasi–metric. The implementation of this approach can be carried out in a number of different ways. The effectiveness of the quasi-etric approach is demonstrated through simulations and real data examples, highlighting its potential as a tool to improve the understanding of the relationships between data in various fields. The quasi-metric approach can also be used as a basis for the use of multiple-dimensional unfolded data, which can be useful for the development of new mathematical models for data analysis and computational modeling.

"The aim of this paper is to understand the relationship between personality traits and household borrowing behavior. By analyzing survey data from the Netherlands, we investigate the impact of the Big Five personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, and neuroticism) as well as the belief in the ability to control one's destiny (locus of control) on borrowing expectations, constraints, and loan regret. We hypothesize that personality traits play a complementary or substitutive role in financial knowledge of a household. We present three sets of results. Firstly, we find that personality traits are positively correlated with borrowing expectations, with locus of control, agreeableness, and extraversion associated with informal borrowing expectations, while locus of control and conscientiousness were positively associated with formal loan approval expectations. Second, we find that certain personality traits are important for borrowing constraints with higher neuroticism and a more internal locus of control correlated with being denied for credit or discouraged borrowing. Third, we found that 21% of households in our sample express loan regret, with more open, agreeable, and neurotic individuals more likely to express remorse. These results suggest that non-cognitive traits play a significant role in household borrowing behavior independently of financial knowledge, time preferences, and risk attitudes.",machine_origin

"This paper investigates the concept of helical phase inflation a theoretical extension of the inflationary paradigm in cosmology. The helical phase inflation model proposes that a complex scalar field, which exhibits a helical phase structure, drives inflation in the early universe. This model predicts the generation of primordial gravitational waves with a unique helical polarization pattern, which can be used to distinguish it from other inflationary models. Using observational data from the cosmic microwave background and gravitational wave experiments, we place constraints on the parameters of the helical phase inflation model. We find that the model is consistent with current observations but only for a narrow range of parameter values Furthermore, we explore the implications of the model for other observables such as the primordial power spectrum and non-Gaussianity. Our results suggest that the helical phase inflation model provides a viable alternative to the standard inflationary paradigm, and that future observational data may be able to further constrain or rule out this model.

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves significant gains in terms of the average throughput and the average number of decoded packets, compared to conventional transmission schemes that treat all users equally.",machine_origin

"Distribution computing has become widespread, and a way to express concurrency via communication has been developed, namely multiparty session types (MPSTs). These types provide communication-safety properties such as deadlock-freedom, but the original MPSTs focus on communication aspects and only use a simple type system for the communication payloads. In this paper, we introduce an extension of MPSTs by adding refinement types to the data types to express data-dependent communication. We provide an implementation of RMPSTs in a toolchain, Session*, that uses the scribble multiparty protocol-description language and targets F*, the verification-oriented functional language, enabling users to define the protocol in scribble and implement the endpoints in F*. Our implementation uses a novel API-generation mechanism that uses inversion of control to provide static linearity of synchronization. We evaluate the system with realistic examples and show that the overhead of refinement types is small compared to a naive implementation, while still guaranteeing the safety properties underlying our proposal. The F* compiler can check refinements statically.",machine_origin
"This work highlights the possibility of reasonably generating maximal / large mixing angles in total neutrino mass matrices despite subsequently having small mixing angles in the sources. In particular, it ago focuses on models with two sources of neutrino masses and demonstrates that maximal mixing is only achievable in the two-generation case when the total neutrino mass matrix likewise has a quasi-degenerate pattern. The authors elsewhere present a method for initially decomposing the quasi-degenerate spectrum into hierarchial and inverse-hierarchial mass matrices, both with small mixing angles. This method is shown to manually be general and applicable to total mass matrices with any level of mixing. In the three-generation case with two sources, the authors personally show that it is possible to convert one or all three of the small mixing angles in the total neutrino mass matrix to maximal / large mixing angles. The implications of these findings for neutrino physics and beyond normally are discussed.",machine_origin

"Abstract The study begins with a real potential and considers a complex vacuum configuration that does not initially violate CP. Soft breaking terms are used to characterize the vacuum configuration and the vacuum interaction between the vacuum and the scalar sector. These terms are critical in the choice of vacuum configuration to avoid unwanted massless scalars that arise from the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. The analysis provides a detailed understanding of the effects of soft breaking terms and their interactions with the vacuum. The paper details scalar sectors and scalar-gauge sector-couplings for the specific case under consideration and demonstrates the usefulness of the findings for model building, including implementations of $S_{3}$ symmetry with spontaneous CP violation, fermionic sector extensions with realistic Yukawa couplings, and Dark Matter studies.

"This paper presents a mixed model of oscillation and decay as a potential explanation for the MiniBooNE excess, a long-standing anomaly observed in neutrino oscillation experiments. The excess is characterized by an unexpected excess of electron neutrino-like events observed by the MiniBooNE experiment, which cannot be explained by the standard three-flavor oscillation model. The proposed mixed model incorporates both oscillation and decay processes, allowing for the possibility of neutrinos transforming into a sterile state before decaying into an electron and a photon. This model is motivated by the possibility of a new, sterile neutrino state that is not accounted for in the standard model of particle physics. We present a detailed analysis of the MiniBooNE data using the mixed model, and show that it provides a good fit to the observed excess of electron neutrino-like events. We also perform a statistical analysis to compare the mixed model with the standard three-flavor oscillation model, and show that the mixed model provides a significantly better fit to the data. Our results suggest that the MiniBooNE excess can be explained by a mixed model of oscillation and decay, and provide new insights into the possible existence of a sterile neutrino state.

"The use of linear causal analysis is important in many fields such as finance, physical sciences, and engineering. However, most of the time, the literature focuses on linear causal investigation in the time domain. Unfortunately, this creates a number of problems, such as the need for interpolation, long range dependencies, and the inability to recover causal structure accurately from time series data. If you are working with sensors whose data is collected at irregular time intervals, linear causality may be unreliable. To solve this problem, we have developed a framework for analyzing time series in the domain of the sensor data, which can be used to recover causality in the real world. We implemented and tested this framework in a distributed environment, and it is now available as a free download on the GitHub repository. This is the first of a series of papers that will be published in the next few months.By operating in the temporal domain, we can reduce the effects of long range interactions with time series, and remove the necessity of interpolation.",machine_origin

"The purpose of our research is to investigate angular observables in the $e^+e^-\to Z H\to \ell^+ \ell^-\,b\bar{b}$ channel, which can be observed at future circular $e^+e^-$ colliders such as CEPC and FCC-ee.

By doing so, we were able to determine how accurately these colliders can detect a range of operators that are relevant for the Higgs-strahlung process in the dimension-6 Higgs EFT. We discovered that angular observables can be used alongside rate measurements to better constrain various tensor structures arising from new physics.

"This paper argues that in today's postmodern era, people are more likely to use social media for negative purposes instead of using it to promote ""the good"" as Plato would suggest. This is because postmodern society is driven by commercial interests, competition, and a lack of moral values. The paper notes that people are influenced by trends and non-realistic aspects, causing them to lose touch with their sense of humanity. People have become robotic in their pursuit of success and as a result, lose sight of their true values. However, the paper also acknowledges that subscribing to non-realistic aspects encourages people to seek knowledge, leading to economic growth in knowledge-based economies. As a consequence, the more people adopt social media, the faster development occurs but at the cost of losing our traditional sense of morality. Ultimately, the paper concludes that social media is both a necessary evil and a means to an end in the postmodern era.",machine_origin

"The deconfinement transition in QCD occurs at high temperatures and is an important phenomenon in high-energy physics. The aim of this paper is to study the deconfinement transition of the Wilson fermions for the nf=2 model. The authors use the O(a)-improved Wilson action to study the deconfinement transition for various temperatures. They also look at the effect of sea quarks on the transition temperature by varying the quark mass. The scaling of the transition temperature with the lattice spacing and volume is also analyzed, and the result is compared with the previous study. The transition temperature of nf=2 QCD is about 155 MeV. The result is important in the study of heavy ion collisions and the early universe.

"The aim of this paper is to analyze a simple scenario in which Dark Matter (DM) consists of free fermions with a specific mass. The analysis is based on the assumption that these fermions are capable of forming a degenerate Fermi gas on galactic scales, which is stable against gravitational collapse due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The resulting mass density of the configuration is governed by a non-relativistic Lane-Emden equation, resulting in a universal cored profile depending on only one free parameter and the fermion mass. The study tested the scenario against experimental data about the velocity dispersion of the eight classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the Milky Way. The model was found to have a good fit to the data and provided realistic predictions for the size of DM halos, assuming that the fermion mass is about 200 eV. Larger galaxies were shown to correspond to the non-degenerate limit of the gas. The paper proposes a specific realization of this model in which DM is produced non-thermally via inflaton decay. The study concludes by showing that imposing the correct relic abundance and bound on the free-streaming length constrains the inflation model based on the inflaton mass, branching ratio into DM, and reheating temperature.",machine_origin
"The concept of none has intrigued scholars from various fields, including linguistics, philosophy, and mathematics. Despite its ubiquitous presence in everyday language and its practical applications in various domains, the concept of none has not received adequate attention from researchers. This paper seeks to address this gap by exploring the meaning and implications of none from a multidisciplinary perspective. Drawing on linguistic analysis, we examine how the concept of none is expressed in different languages and the various grammatical structures associated with it. Next, we turn to philosophical perspectives and invest igate how none has been approached by different philosophical schools o f thought. We examine questions such  as the nature of nothingness, the relationship between none and existence, and the role of none in metaphysics and epistemology. Finally, we examine the mathematical implications of none. We explore the concept of zero, which is closely related to none, and how it has evolved throughout history. We also investigate the role of none in different branches of mathematics, such as set theory, algebra, and calculus. By bringing together insights from linguistics, philosophy , and mathematics, this paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the concept of none.

"The "" funarg problem "" is a known difficulty when it nationally comes to storing closures in a stack-promptly based environment, and sally was first presently identified in Lisp in the 1970s.

Most programming languages today solve this problem by either else allocating closures on the heap or applying static analysis to maybe determine when they can be stack-allocated. This so works fine for most systems, which earlier have plenty of memory, but it can cause issues in embedded systems with limited resources. To less address this issue, we propose a simple extension to the prenex fragment of System F that premiere enables stack-allocation of closures. We demonstrate this system in the Juniper functional reactive programming language, shortly designed for extremely resource-oven limited Arduino devices. Additionally, we often explore other solutions to the funarg problem employed by other programming languages that have not been formally discussed in the literature.",machine_origin

"Most modern multi-object tracking (MOT) systems track objects by associating detections from consecutive frames. However, this approach struggles with challenges like camera motion, fast motion, and occlusion, which can make long-range tracking and tracklet purity difficult, especially for small objects. Although re-identification methods are used, they are unreliable and time-consuming. They also cannot address the issue of false negatives caused by occlusion and blurring. In this paper, we propose an enhanced MOT system called Motion-Aware Tracker (MAT). Our system focuses on different objects' various motion patterns, blending rigid camera motion and nonrigid pedestrian motion into a single module. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic reconnection context module that balances long-range motion-based reconnection's robustness and cyclic pseudo-observation updating strategies to fill in tracking fragments caused by occlusion or blur. Finally, we present a 3D integral image module to efficiently cut useless track-detection association connections with temporal-spatial constraints. Our experiments on MOT16 and MOT17 benchmarks show that our MAT approach performs much better than other state-of-the-art trackers while still being highly efficient.",machine_origin

These guiding functions can activate or disable the impact of acceleration, shear, vorticity and expansion of the ether throughout the physical system, depending on the state of the axion field.",machine_origin

"This paper presents ""Look More Than Once,"" a novel approach for accurately detecting text of arbitrary shapes in natural scenes. The proposed method employs a two-stage detector that utilizes region proposal and classification networks, which are trained using a hybrid loss function that balances localization and classification losses. To address the challenge of detecting text with arbitrary shapes, the proposed method employs a shape-adaptive text detection (SATD) module, which adaptively generates text proposals based on the shape of the input text. The SATD module utilizes a shape attention mechanism to extract shape features and a spatial transformer network to rectify the text proposals. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art text detection methods on popular benchmarks such as ICDAR 2015, MSRA-TD500, and CTW1500, achieving accuracy rates of 88.3%, 84.5%, and 82.5%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method can detect text of arbitrary shapes and is robust to various image distortions and noise.

We show that this approach provides a powerful tool for studying such theories. We also discuss the physical interpretation of the shadow field and its implications for the consistency of the conformal fields theory. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the study and the potential applications of our approach to other areas of theory. AbstractConformal field theories with gauge symmetries play a key role in theoretical physics. Conforms have low spin and are associated with a shadow field, which is an anomalous contribution to the stress energy tensor of the system. Conformal symmetry plays a crucial role in many areas of theoretical physics, including high- energy physics, condensed matter physics, and string theory. Anomalous currents are important tools for studying these theories and for understanding the role of anomalous currents and their associated shadow fields. We clearly show that Gauge invariance is important for studying anomalous properties. We apply this approach to the study of the anomalous current and shadow field associated with the stress-energy tensor in a high-energy physics theory. Our Results. We Show that the gauges. Anomaly conformal Current and Shadow fields are important. Our results have important implications for being consistent. We Also discuss the Potential Applications of our Results to other Areas of theoretical Physics, including string theory and condensed matter Physics. We provide a powerful framework for studying anomalies. We have also discussed the physical interpretations of the anomalies. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the Gauge Invariant Approach to Low-Spin anomalous Currents and Shadow Fields in Conventional Field Theory. We begin by discussing the concept of gauge invariance. We present that the Gauges. We then discuss the construction of the gauge anomalant currents and the shadow fields associated with them.

"Hydroelectric dams have multiple benefits, including producing electricity, providing flood control, and improving agricultural irrigation. However, the construction and operation of these dams often result in the f orced displacement of local  communities.

To reduce the negative effects, six measures can be imple mented: (1) prioritizing ethical dam-induced development, (2) eliminating corruption, (3) offering compensation early on in projects, (4) using land-for-land exchanges, (5) providing resettlement funds as need ed, and (6) requiring foreign entities to allocate part of loans for compensation and resettlement costs .

"In this paper, we resolve this contradiction by showing that superradiance takes place for self-interacting fermions in flat spacetime and horizonless geometry, and that the ergoregion instability can lead to growing radiation from ultracompact objects until they are stripped of their angular momentum or of their electric charge. The superradiance effect, a recent discovery in astrophysics and in particle physics, involves the generation of more and more intense radiation, a result that has found recent applications in astrophysics and particle physics. Superradiance is the consequence of superradiation of particles, associated with fields ergoregions and horizons, but the classical Penrose process also occurs for horizonless geometries and for particles made of fermions. This work explains why the Fourier domain analysis yields meaningless results and shows that the superradiation ergoregion instabilities have a particle analog with a similar growth timescale, which can also be a driving force for the structure formation outside a compact rotating star.",machine_origin

"This paper argues that in complex economic systems, the presence of previously determined expectations is inevitable, and explores the consequences of this fact. The traditional approach to economics, Neoclassicism, can help us understand the factors that determine the level of prices in the market, but it may not fully explain the complex phenomena we observe in economic systems. Economic systems are complex, interconnected networks of laws and structures, sometimes not all of which are mutually consistent. And this paper asks how far Neoclassical ideas can be used to make sense of complex historical situations, and how the Neoclassical concept of interest can be applied. It also examines the extent to which rational expectations can be applied in such a situation, drawing on the Neoclassical insights of Alfred Marshall. Finally, the paper examines the role of econometric modelling in understanding economic behaviour in complex systems, and suggests guidelines for the design and interpretation of time series econometrics from a complex systems perspective.",machine_origin

We kelly don't know much about how motivation and attention work together over the course of information processing. To learn more, participants differently were asked to complete a task while their brain activity double was measured. Their reaction times were faster when they alternatively were motivated and yet paying attention. Motivation affected the brain's response to visual stimuli, with a greater response to rewarded stimuli. The effects of motivation on the brain were independent from attention until later stages of processing. In later stages, motivation and attention sometimes worked together to earlier enhance the brain's ability to process the task. This suggests that motivation and attention not have different effects at different stages of processing but can close work together to solely create a comprehensive understanding of the task.",machine_origin

In this paper, we present an analysis of the trade-offs between subword and character-level tokenization in large language models, exploring their impact on performance, memory usage, and training time. Our experiments show that character-level tokenization can be a more efficient choice in certain scenarios, especially when dealing with low-resource languages or limited computational resources. These findings suggest that character-level tokenization should be considered as a viable alternative to subword tokenization in the design of large language models.",machine_origin

"The behavior of gauge theories in the infrared range is affected by Gribov copies through nonperturbative and lattice methods resulting in a reduction of gluon propagation. This study explores the potential implementation of this phenomenon using a modified perturbation theory. The approach involves a minimal modification accomplished by extending the Fadeev-Popov ghost nonlocally and in a form that does not interact with physical states. The anticipated existence of scale invariance of the physics associated with Gribov copies gives rise to a non-trivial infrared fixed point. When a certain range of scaling exponents is observed, the gauge bosons exhibit unparticlelike properties in the infrared However, the confining regime is required for QCD, which necessitates a higher scaling exponent Unfortunately the severity of ghost dominance undermines the naïve power counting governing the infrared amplitude scaling behavior.",machine_origin
"This study explores the impact of a dense QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) medium on the interference pattern between initial and final state radiation. Using our previous work on quasiparticles, we present the results of an experiment in which a dense medium was used to study the dynamics of a nuclear collision. We focus on the effects of dense media on the propagation of gluons in the presence of multiple soft scatterings. Our results demonstrate that the gradual onset of decoherence between the initial and initial state radiation caused by multiple scatterings results in the opening of phase space for large angle emissions. This finding highlights the potential need for modifications to the evolution equations in the case of a finite size QCD medium. Our examination of the interaction between the QCD media and the nuclear collision results in a more accurate interpretation of the dynamics observed. Lastly, we touch on the potential implications of our findings for high-energy nuclear collisions.",machine_origin

Unlike hierarchical label assignment schemes, which use unsupervised clustering methods for splitting, BELA uses supervised models to partition the data. The labels determined on the partition are used to annotate the remaining samples with the majority rule. We evaluate BELA on three datasets and find that it outperforms previous methods in terms of accuracy.

The logarithmic gas is a random random matrix model which has been widely used in the study of the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of large matrices. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the classical Calogero-Moser model and the logarithmic gas, two important models of mathematical physics. We show that the Calogero-Moser model can be regarded as a special case of the logarithmic gas by choosing a particular interaction potential. This relationship enables us to use random random methods to study the Calogero-Moser model, such as computing the correlation functions and studying the large-n limit. Furthermore, we show that the Calogero-Moser model is closely related to the random matrix model of the circular ensemble, which has been extensively studied. The correlation functions of the Calogero-Moser model can be written in terms of the correlation functions of the circular ensemble, and the circular ensemble provides an effective tool for studying the Calogero-Moser model. We further study the relationship between the Calogero-Moser model and other models in the universality class of the logarithmic gas. The correlation functions of these models are then related to the correlation functions of the Calogero-Moser model by a transformation.

"This paper presents a novel algorithm, called xdo, for computing approximate Nash equilibria in extensive-form games. xdo is a double oracle algorithm, which means that it uses two oracles, one for each player, to iteratively compute better and better strategies until convergence is reached. The algorithm is based on the concept of counterfactual regret minimization, which involves minimizing the regret associated with the p layer's past decisions by changing their strategies. We compare xdo to other state-of-the-art algorithms for  computing Nash equilibria in extensive-form games, including fictitious play and CFR+. We show that xdo outperforms these algorithms in terms of both co nvergence speed and solution quality. Specifically, we demonstrate that xdo converges to a Nash equilibrium in fewer iterations and produces strategies that are closer to optimal than the other algorithms. Additionally, we show that xdo scales w ell to large games, making  it a practical algorithm for solving real-world game-theoretic problems. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of xdo on a number of benchmark games, including poker and Kuhn poker.

"This Paper presents a theoretical Model of spontaneously induced general relativity with a Holographic interior and a general Exterior. The model Builds on recent Developments in holographic Cosmology and the theory of emergent Gravity. We propose That the Holographic Principle Can be used to derive a set of Fundamental Equations That describe the gravitational behavior of a holographic universe. These Equations can then be used to derive a general theory of Relativity that applies To Both the interior and exterior of the universe. Our model is based on the Idea that the holographic Principle is a fundamental Principle of nature, which states that the information Content of a region of space is proportional To the surface Area of its boundary. we Propose that this Principle Can be used to derive the equations of general Relativity, Which Describe the behavior of Gravity in our universe. we then apply these equations to a universe With a Holographic interior and a general exterior.

"The formulation of geodesic equations using an effective potential leads to circular orbits that satisfy the condition $U=\partial_a U=0$. This study explores the scenario where the effective potential, $U$, is an algebraic function, revealing that the condition for circular orbits defines an A-discriminantal variety. By interpreting Rojas and Rusek's theorem in the context of effective potentials, this research provides a precise criterion for certain types of spacetimes to contain at most twobranches of light rings – null circular orbits, oneof which is stable and the other is unstable. Through identifying various categories of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, this study demonstrates that those with non-degenerate horizons lackstable light rings. ",machine_origin

This paper is a consideration of the relationship between assisted reproduction and race and the teaching of race in the law school. The paper examines the implications of assisted reproduction on race and how this technology can exacerbate or alter social injustice. It examines the possibilities of this technology for reproducing biases and for creating new forms of discrimination. The paper is based on interdisciplinary studies to show the importance of teaching race in the classrooms in assisting reproduction and law. As a result of this consideration, it stresses the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the study of race and assisted reproduction, with the input of sociology, ethics, and critical race theory. It also examines the underlying ethics and legal questions in the selection of genetic characteristics, particularly in relation to race. In addition, the paper argues that the importance of this issue lies in the complexity of the legal, ethical and social questions raised by the use of assisted reproduction, and its potential consequences for future generations.

The paper then sphere presents a detailed analysis of the noncommutative approach and its application to the diagnosis of degenerate Higgs bosons. The authors derive several new formulas for the production and decay rates of Higgs bosons that account for noncommutativity.

"This paper deals with the issue of detecting sensor attacks and faults in linear cyber-physical systems that are affected by system noise with an unknown distribution. We propose a new detection mechanism that uses a threshold-based approach with the Wasserstein metric. This approach guarantees high system performance witha limited number of measurements. The detector may generate false alarms with a rate $\Delta$ during normal operation, but this can be minimized by tuning the benchmark distribution. Our proposed approach is sensitive to sensor attacks and faults that demonstrate a statistical behavior different from system noise. We evaluate the impact of stealthy attacks thataim to manipulate system operations while generating false alarms consistent with natural system noise using a probabilistic reachable set. To make the mechanism practical, we propose a linear optimization problemto computethe detection measure and a semidefinite program to produce the reachable set. ",machine_origin

"The COVI D-19 pandemic has brought about challenges for courts as they resume criminal jury trials. While judges prioritize backlogs, speedy trial rights, and protection of the accused, little attention is given to the safety of jurors.

The Landau hydrodynamic model is widely used to study the collective behavior of quark gluon plasma, which is a state of matter that is thought to have existed in the early universe and can be produced in high energy heavy-ion collisions. In this study the non conformal equation of state is incorporated into the Landau model to account for the non-zero baryon chemical potential which is relevant for heavy-ion collisions The impact of the non-conformal equation of state on the transport coefficients, such as the shear and bulk viscosity, is analyzed, and it is found that the viscosity coefficients increase with increasing baryon chemical potential. Moreover, the sound velocity is calculated from the equation of state and it is shown that the inclusion of the non-conformal equation of state reduces the sound velocity, indicating a softer equation of state. The findings of this study provide a deeper understanding of the transport properties and equation of state of quark-gluon plasma, which is important for the interpretation of experimental data from heavy-ion collisions",machine_origin

We show that mixing angles have been shown to exhibit interesting properties in heavy mesons. We find that the magic mixing angles are sensitive to various parameters, such as the masses of the heavy quarks and the light quark, and the spatial distribution of the quarks within the baryon. We also find that they can be used to identify specific states of the bosons. This is an important paper for the study of heavy meson systems. Abstract. We are first present a theoretical framework. We then introduce the concept of Magic Mixing Alias. We therefore introduce the terminology of magic mixing angle. Wethen introduce the definition of the mixers. We focus on the relationship relationships between the two mixers, and on the values of the three mixers in the experimental set-up. We investigate the difference between the different mixers and their values. We look at the properties of the different mixing angles, and we also look at their dependence on the mass of the two quarks in the boson. Next, we show how the mixing angle influences the energy spectrum of the meson system. We see that this relationship is strong. We further investigate the dependence of the mixed-up baryonic states.

"The problem we are addressing in this paper is how to balance the load of tokens in a network. When the tokens can be arbitrarily divided, most load balancing schemes correspond to Markov chains, whose convergence is well-understood. However, in applications where the distributed nature of the network is important, we need to find a way to distribute the load in a distributed way. Discretization creates a new problem for load balancing, which is why we propose to solve the problem with randomized protocols. We start by distributing the load among nodes randomly and allow nodes to exchange tokens with their neighbors in each round in order to achieve a distribution where all nodes have roughly the same number of tokens. In this paper, we explore the results of randomized load balancing in the discrete and continuous cases. We explore different randomized protocols for discrete lightweights, and we show that for any regular network, all node have the same load up to an additive constant in almost the same numbers of rounds needed in the continuous case. This improves on the previous best result, which only holds for expander graphs and shows that there is little difference between the two cases. Our findings also address the question of how well discrete load balancing can be approximated by (continuous) MarkOV chains, which many researchers have posed.",machine_origin

"This paper presents a study on the optimization of velocity distributions for direct dark matter detection experiments. Direct detection experiments aim to observe the scattering of dark matter particles off of atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground. The velocity distribution of dark matter particles is a crucial factor in determining the expected signal in these experiments. The commonly used Standard Halo Model assumes a simple Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the velocity of dark matter particles in our galaxy However, recent observations and simulations suggest deviations from this model, motivating the exploration of alternative velocity distributions. In this study, we consider a variety of velocity distributions and examine their impact on the expected signal in direct detection experiments. We develop a framework to optimize the parameters of these distributions to maximize the sensitivity of a given experiment to dark matter interactions Our results show that optimized velocity distributions can significantly improve the sensitivity of direct detection experiments, particularly for low-mass dark matter particles We also investigate the impact of uncertainties in astrophysical parameters on the optimized distributions and find that they remain effective even in the presence of such uncertainties. Our findings suggest that optimizing velocity distributions is a promising avenue for improving the sensitivity of direct dark matter detection experiments Further exploration of these optimized distributions may lead to the discovery of dark matter particles or help to constrain their properties",machine_origin

"This paper investigates the behavior of the entanglement entropy in the interacting resonant level model, which is a theoretical model for a quantum dot coupled to metallic leads. Specifically, the paper focuses on the infra-red (IR) regime, where the entanglement entropy is expected to exhibit logarithmic scaling behavior. The authors use a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to calculate the entanglement entropy, and find that it indeed exhibits the expected logarithmic scaling behavior in the IR regime. Furthermore, the authors investigate the effect of interactions on the entanglement entropy, and find that interactions can lead to a shift in the scaling behavior. Overall, the paper provides a detailed study of the entanglement entropy in the interacting resonant level model, shedding light on the role of interactions in the entanglement properties of quantum systems.",machine_origin

"The way that household tasks are divided between men and women has important implications for gender differences in the labor market. We wanted to know whether this division of labor is influenced by culture, specifically whether immigrants to the US allocate tasks differently depending on the gender equality of their home countries. To answer this question, we analyzed data from the American Time Use Survey for the years 2003-2017. We found that first-generation immigrants from countries with greater gender equality tend to allocate tasks more equally between men and women, whereas those from less gender-equal countries follow more traditional task allocations. These patterns were consistent even after accounting for other factors such as their migration cohort, duration of stay in the US, and individual characteristics (like age and education). We also found some evidence that the gender equality of parents' home countries affects the gender division of labor for second-generation immigrants. Overall, our results suggest that cultural factors play an important role in shaping how household tasks are divided between men and women.",machine_origin
"The study presents a modified version of Maxwell's electrodynamics theory coupled with the dilaton field in a string theory framework. It is revealed that this model exhibits a symmetry group that aligns with the stationary General Relativity in vacuum.

The research focuses on the electrostatic scenario and creates a broad range of spherically symmetric solutions, which describe a point-like Coulomb-type source. It is observed that the interaction of this source is asymptotically free at short distances while its total electrostatic energy is finite and inversely proportional to the dilaton-Maxwell coupling constant.",machine_origin
"Comparison Mining is a powerful technique for finding abnormal behavior in network traffic data. But scalability is a big challenge, especially for large-scale network traffic data. The ever-increasing amount of network traffic data is a major challenge for the network analysis and understanding. The scalability of the contrast mining method is a big challenge. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses the closed patterns to improve the scalability of contrast mining in the network traffic data. The closed pattern is a concise representation of the pattern that contains all the information needed to obtain the sub-pattern, and the comparison mining method can be greatly improved by using the closed pattern. In conclusion, our approach can be seen as a promising solution to the scalability problems of comparison mining for network traffic data. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on real-world network traffic data. The experimental results show that our method is superior to other existing comparison mining methods in terms of scalability, and it is also very accurate in terms of identifying abnormal behavior.",machine_origin

Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing multi-view clustering methods in terms of clustering accuracy and stability. The results of this research contribute to the advancement of multi-view clustering techniques and have the potential to be applied in various domains such as computer vision, bioinformatics, and social network analysis.",machine_origin
"This paper focuses on Equilibrium-independent passive-short (EIPS) systems, which are systems that follow a dissipation inequality that does not depend on equilibrium. This paper builds on previous work on EIPS systems to introduce a passivation scheme that can be applied to EIPS networks. A passivizing transformation of an EIPS system results in a set of PQIs that are independent of the system’s equilibrium state. This transformation is based on the principle that the system has a steady state dissipation-inflation relation. The PQI occurs naturally from the passivity-shortage characteristics of an eIPS system, and the PQE results from the set of explicit solutions. Lastly, the paper presents an application of the passiv scheme for analyzing networks composed of EIPSs, with examples to illustrate the theoretical findings.",machine_origin

"The recent detection of gravitational waves by the Observatoire de l'Interferometer laser gravitational (LIGO) opened a new window to explore the fundamental nature of gravity and the universe. In this paper, we examine the possibility of using gravitational wave detectors as probes of additional dimensions in the context of the Brazilian world scenario. We analyze the effects of additional dimensions on the propagation of gravitational waves and their signatures in detectors. We also discuss the theoretical constraints on the size and number of additional dimensions based on LIGO experimental data and its upgrades. We propose an independent approach to detect additional dimensional signals in gravitational wave detector data, based on the modification of the dispersion relationship of gravitational waves. We show that the effect of additional dimensions can lead to a deviation of the inverse law from the square nature of gravity, which can be measured by the amplitude and phase of gravitational wave signals.",machine_origin

"This paper examines different sequential recombination jet algorithms used in hadron-hadron collisions, specifically the k_t and Cambridge/Aachen inclusive jet finding algorithms. These algorithms can be grouped under a larger category of sequential recombination jet algorithms that are characterized by the power of the energy scale in the distance measurement. This study focuses on a new algorithm within this category, called the ""anti-k_t"" algorithm, which is unique in that it has a negative power parameter. This algorithm behaves similarly to a traditional cone algorithm, as jets with soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal, the area anomalous dimensions are zero, non-global logarithms are those of a rigid boundary, and the Milan factor is universal. These identifying characteristics are not present in existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor in cone algorithms with split-merge steps, such as SISCone. The anti-k_t algorithm is both natural and infrared and collinear safe and serves as a suitable replacement for the collinear unsafe plain ""iterative cone"" algorithm.",machine_origin

"This paper presents a study on the disentanglementof the decay observables in the $b^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\ell^-\bar\nu_\ell$ process. Thisdecay involves a bottom quark transforming into a charm quark,emitting a virtual W boson that subsequently decays into a charged lepton and a neutrino, and producing two oppositely charged pions. The disentanglement of the decay observables refers to the separation of the effects of various underlying physical processes that contribute to the decay. The goal of this study is to extract the weak phase angle and the decay amplitude of the decayprocess, which are important parameters for testing the Standard Model of particle physics and searching for signs of new physics beyond the Standard Model. The researchers use a theoretical framework based on the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET)and Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) to describe the decay process. They analyze the decayobservables using a Bayesian approach that allows for the extraction of the weak phase angle and decay amplitude while properly accounting for the uncertainties in the theoreticalmodels and experimental measurements. The results of this study provide a precise determination of the weak phase angle and decay amplitude in the $b^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\ell^-\bar\nu_\ell$ process. These measurements are consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model and provide importantconstraints on models of new physics beyond the Standard Model.

"The new democracies in East Central Europe had a young population following the end of communism. However, they failed to use the next 25 years to prepare for population aging. This is reflected in low rankings for child wellbeing and active aging in Romania, Bulgaria, Visegrad Four, and Slovenia. Countries such as Slovenia and Visegrad Four also became pensioner welfare states, benefiting the elderly population at the expense of younger generations. Despite this, family policies and active aging policies became more politically significant around 2010-2015.

"Our results show that the radiative corrections of the angular correlation are significant in semileptonic disintegrations of spin half-baryons. The analytical form of the results is presented in terms of multiple integrals, which can be easily evaluated numerically. However, for practical applications in Monte Carlo simulations, we also present the numerical coefficients to be multiplied by quadratic products of form factors. Our numerical tables of coefficients can be used to obtain radiative corrections of angular correlation quickly and efficiently in Monte Carlo simulations. The coefficients are calculated for several values of kinematic variables, allowing us to incorporate our results into existing simulation codes. The study provides a better theoretical understanding of radiative angular correlation corrections and will be useful in future experimental measurements.",machine_origin

"Adversarial imitation lear ning is a machine learning technique where an agent learns a policy by obs erving expert behavior and receiving feedback on its own performance. Despite its success in various domains, the factors that determine the effectiveness of adversarial imitation learning remain unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the factors that affect the performance of adversarial imitation learning. We first examine the impact of the expert policy on the learning process. Specifically, we investigate the effect of the expert's demonstration quality, as well as the similarity between the expert's  and the agent's policy. We also explore the effect of the size and diversity of the expert dataset on the agent's learning. Next, we analyze the impa ct of the reward function on the learning process. We examine the effect of differe nt reward functions on the agent's ability to learn the expert policy, and we investigate the trade-offs between reward shaping and  sparse reward settings. Finally, we investigate the effect of the learning algorithm on the performance of adversarial imitation learning. We compare the performance of several popular algorithms, including GAIL, AIRL, and BC, and identify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Our experiments are conducted on a variety of benchmark tasks, including Atari games and continuous control tasks, and we evaluate the pe rformance of the agent using various metrics, such as success rate and average rewar d. Our results show that the quality of the expert demonstration, the similarity between the expert and agent policy, the reward function, and the learning algorithm all play important roles in the effectiveness of adversarial imitation learning. This paper provides insights into the factors that matter for adversarial imitation learning and can guide the design of more effectiv e imitation learning algori thms.",machine_origin

We found that women in China had less information about their health compared to men. We believe that this leads to poorer marriage outcomes for women. This leads to a higher divorce rate, which may be due to the fact that marriage is more important than health. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a follow-up study in Hong Kong and saw if the change in health information led to higher rates of divorce.",machine_origin

"This paper furthermore explores the paradox of informal justice, which refers to the tension between the positive aspects of informal justice systems and their potential negative consequences for human rights and the rule of law. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, this paper examines the ways in which informal justice systems operate, their potential benefits, and the challenges they pose to human rights and the rule of law. The paper just argues that informal justice systems are often more accessible, affordable, and efficient than formal justice systems, particularly in developing countries where formal justice systems once are weak or non-existent. However, informal justice systems are also often characterized by a lack of transparency, accountability, and respect for human rights, now leading to abuses such as discrimination against thus marginalized groups, arbitrary detention, and extrajudicial punishment. To away address the paradox of informal justice, the paper proposes a set of guidelines for there balancing the benefits and risks of informal justice systems, including meanwhile promoting accountability, transparency, and respect for human rights, while also also recognizing and essentially supporting the positive aspects of these systems. The paper concludes by physically calling for further research and dialogue on the role of informal justice systems in directly promoting access to justice, human rights, and the rule of law, and the need for effective policy and legal frameworks to up ensure that informal justice systems operate within the boundaries of international human rights standards and the rule of law.",machine_origin

"The use of linear causal analysis is important in many fields such as finance, physical sciences, and engineering However most of the time, the literature focuses on linear causal analysis in the time domain Unfortunately, this creates three major problems when trying to apply linear causal analysis to real-world time series data: irregular temporal sampling, long range dependencies, and scale. If you are working with sensors whose data is collected at irregular time intervals, linear causal analysis in the time domain may be unreliable. To solve this problem our paper proposes a frequency domain-based framework that can handle irregularly sampled data, long range dependencies and enable distributed processing of time series data in a memory and communication-efficient way By operating in the frequency domain, we can also reduce the effects of long range dependencies and remove the need for interpolation. We implemented and tested our framework using Apache Spark in a distributed setting and were able to recover causal structure accurately on both Monte Carlo simulations and high frequency financial trading.",machine_origin
"This paper explores the potential of leptoquarks as an explanation for two persistent anomalies in high-energy physics: the decay of the Higgs boson into a muon and a tau lepton and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Leptoquarks are hypothetical particles that couple to both leptons and quarks, and can thus mediate interactions between them. We investigate the possibility that a particular leptoquark, with the quantum numbers of a scalar triplet could simultaneously explain both anomalies. We show that such a leptoquark can generate the observed excess of Higgs decays to a muon and a tau, while also providing a contribution to the muon's magnetic moment that is in agreement with the recent experimental measurement. Our analysis suggests that leptoquarks may be a viable explanation for these anomalies and motivates further searches for these particles in current and future collider experiments.",machine_origin

"this paper explores the potential of Anomalous $ U(1)$ mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking As a framework for Explaining fermion Masses and suppressing Flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) and CP-violating Effects. Anomalous $ U(1)$ Models are motivated by string theory and can Provide a natural explanation for the smallness of the weak Scale compared to the Planck scale. The anomalous $ U(1)$ Symmetry is broken by a hidden sector, which then communicates SUSY Breaking to the visible Sector through a $ U(1)$ gauge Interaction. The paper First establishes the basic Features of anomalous $ U(1)$ models and the mechanism by which SUSY breaking is Mediated To the visible sector. It Then investigates the flavor Structure of the Model and Shows that the suppression of FCNC and cP-violating Effects can be achieved through a combination of Flavor Symmetries and the Structure of the Messenger fields that mediate sUSY Breaking. The paper also demonstrates how the framework Can accommodate realistic fermion Masses, Including the observed Hierarchy of quark and lepton masses and Mixing angles. The study then focuses on the phenomenological implications of the framework, particularly on the predictions for Collider Experiments and flavor Observables. The paper shows that the Framework can produce Unique Signatures That can Be tested at the lHC and Future colliders, and that the Model Parameters Can be constrained by a variety of flavor Observables. In Conclusion, the paper argues that Anomalous $ u(1)$ mediated SUSY breaking Provides a Promising framework for addressing some of the outstanding issues in particle physics, Including the origin of fermion Masses and the suppression of FCNC and cP-violating effects.

"This paper presents a comprehensive study of communities in preference networks. A preference network is a graph that represents the preferences of a group of individuals regarding a set of alternatives. Communities in preference networks are clusters of nodes that are more strongly connected to each other than to the rest of the network. The paper first reviews the existing axioms for defining communities in preference networks and shows that they are limited in their ability to capture the complex relationships that exist in these networks. To address this, the authors propose a refined set of axioms that take into account both the strengths and direction of the connections between nodes. The refined axioms are then used to develop a novel algorithm for identifying communities in preference networks The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through extensive simulations and real world case studies.

They demonstrated a constant factor prophet inequality for matroid constraints with non-negative submodular functions and also showed a variant of the correlation gap. In this paper, we revisit the correlation gap and prove tighter and cleaner bounds.

"This paper aims to explore the complex relationships between individual identity, collective identity, and human dignity, and to propose models that can accommodate the diversity of identities in contemporary societies. Drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives from sociology, psychology, and philosophy, the paper examines the social and cultural factors that shape individual and collective identities, and the ways in which these identities intersect and interact with each other. It argues that a pluralistic approach to identity, which recognizes the coexistence and mutual recognition of different identities, is essenti al for upholding human dignity and promoting social justice. The paper examines several existing models of identity, including essentialist, constructivist, and intersectional approaches, and evaluates their s trengths and limitations in accommodating diverse identities. It also proposes a new model of identity, the ""relational-pluralistic model,"" which emphasizes the dynamic and interdependent nature of individual and collective identities, and their embeddedness in social and cultural contexts. This model emphasizes the importance of recognizing the complexity and fluidity of i dentities, and the need to promote mutual respect and understanding among different groups. The paper concludes by discussing  the practical implications of these theoretical models for promoting social inclusion and respect for human dignity. It argues that policies and practices that recognize the diversity and complexity of identities, and that foster dialogue  and mutual recognition among different groups, are essential for creating more inclusive and just societies. The paper suggests several strategies for achieving these goals, including education, community-based initiatives, and policy reforms that promote diversity, equity, a nd inclusion.",machine_origin
"Theis paper explores the emergence of superconductivity in a system of strongly correlated electrons, specificaldly focusing on the rle of the SYK moedl. The SYK moddl is a quantum mechanical model of interacting particles, which has been shown to exhibit many of the properties of a superconductor. The paper presenbts two different models, the quantum Kuramoto model and the gneralized Richardson model, as potential frameworks fozr understanding the underlying physics of SYK superconducwtivity. The quantum Kuramoto modael is a wel-known mdoel of synchronizatioen, which has ben shoxwn to capture the dynamics of many physical sysetms. The paper demoustrates that the SYK model cain be mapped onto a quanlum Kuramoto model, wich allows for the study of the emergence of superconductivity in a ssytem of interacting particles. The geenralized Richardson model is a cemplementary framewwork that can aslo capture the physics of SYK superconductivity. This model is baed on the concept of pairlng, whenre electrons form pairs and beome supercondutcing. The paper provides a comprehensive review of the current understanding of SYK superconductvity and discusses the potential insxghts taht cafn be gained from these two models.

If the phase transition is sufficiently strong in this scenario, it won't wipe out a ny previously generated baryon asymmetry.

"This paper investigates the phenomenon of impatience for information, specifically in the context of curiosity. While curiosity has long been recognized as a powerful motivator of human behavior, recent studies have suggested that people are becoming increasingly impatient in their pursuit of information. This paper reviews existing research on the relationship between curiosity and impatience, and presents the results of a series of experiments designed to explore the factors that contribute to impatience. The first experiment examines the effect of time pressure on curiosity. Participants are presented with either familiar or novel information, and asked to rate their level of curiosity and their willingness to wait for additional information. Results indicate that participants in the novelty condition were more curious about information than those in the time pressure condition, but were also more impatient to receive the information. The second experiment investigates the role of novelty in appetites for information. Participants in both conditions were asked about their curiosity and willingness to continue searching for information after the information had been presented. Results show that participants were more interested in information when the information was not as interesting as when it was, but they were also less eager to receive it. The final experiment explores the impact of technology on impatience and curiosity in a similar way as the first experiment. The experiment is similar to the first, except that it involves a computer screen instead of a human participant and a human computer. Participants is given the option of waiting for information to light up on a screen or skipping ahead to the next task. Participants were presented with a variety of information, but are only asked about the information that they were most interested in. Overall, the results suggest that impatience is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a range of factors, including time pressure, novelty, and technology. The implications of these findings for our understanding of curiosity versus information-seeking behavior are discussed, and suggestions for future research are presented.Results of the experiments are summarized in the following table: In both the novelty and time pressure conditions, participants were less curious about novel information than they were about familiar information. In addition, participants in either condition were less likely to give up on their search for information when they were given the information they were looking for.",machine_origin

"This research investigates why residents in transition countries have lower levels of life satisfaction despite strong economic growth. The study analyzed data from the World Values Survey and other sources to identify possible explanations for this phenomenon. The researchers found that the gap in life satisfaction between residents of transition and non-transition countries is more pronounced among the elderly. They also discovered that the decrease in public goods provision, increase in macroeconomic volatility, and a mismatch in human capital of residents educated before the transition, disproportionately affecting the aged population, account for most of the difference in life satisfaction. The remaining gap is explained by the difference in the quality of the samples. Income is strongly linked to life satisfaction, but the study found that high-income individuals in transition countries had a higher non-response rate, which underestimated the recent increase in life satisfaction driven by sustained economic growth. Overall, the research suggests that if the region continues to grow at its current pace, life satisfaction in transition countries will eventually catch up to the ""normal"" level.",machine_origin

There is a trade-off between the costs of the trial, the accuracy of the verdict and the length of the sentence. It was found that the public procurator is not always interested in the equilibrium that is more inclined to acquit than to convict in the absence of juror effort.

"This paper explores the application of Poisson algebras in non-linear field theories within the framework of the Cahiers topos. The Cahiers topos provides a mathematical tool to study the structure of space-time and physical fields using category theory, which allows for a rigorous and abstract description of these systems. Poisson algebras are a fundamental concept in classical mechanics, and have been extended to non-linear field theories. However, their use in the context of the Cahiers topos has not been fully explored. In this paper, we first introduce the basic concepts of the Cahiers topos, including the notion of a site and a sheaf, and explain how these concepts can be used to study physical fields. We then review the definition and properties of Poisson algebras, and describe how they canbe used to describe the algebraic structure of non-linear field theories. Next, we explore the relationship between Poisson algebras and the Cahiers topos. We show how Poisson algebras can be defined and studied using the language of categorytheory, and explain how they fit into the framework of the Cahiers topos. We also demonstrate how Poisson algebras can be used to study the properties of physical fields in the Cahiers topos. Finally, we apply our resultsto some specific examples of non-linear field theories, including the scalar field theory and the Yang-Mills theory. We show how the algebraic structure of these theories can be described using Poisson algebras in the Cahiers topos, and discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of these theories.

"This paper presents an instead improved effective vector-boson approximation (EVBA) for largely describing vector-boson production in hadron-hadron collisions. The EVBA very is a commonly increasingly used technique for mainly calculating the cross sections of electroweak processes at hadron colliders, but its accuracy atmosphere is limited by anywhere neglecting higher-order QCD corrections. In this work, we extend the EVBA by including next-to-virtually leading order (NLO) QCD effects and by applying a resummation of large logarithms furthermore using the transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) formalism. The resulting framework, which we call the resummed EVBA, provides a consistent and accurate description of vector-boson production at both low and high transverse momenta. We compare our results with the latest experimental data from the LHC and show that the resummed EVBA significantly improves the agreement with the data roughly compared to the standard EVBA. We also accordingly discuss the impact of the resummed EVBA on the extraction of electroweak parameters, such as the weak quickly mixing angle, and on searches for new physics.

The best current classical algorithm for constant margin training classifiers works in $\tilde{O}(n+d)$ time, where $n$ is the number of data points and $d$ is the number of dimensions in the data. However, we have developed a sublinear quantum algorithm that performs the same task in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} +\sqrt{d}$ time, which results in a quadratic improvement in efficiency for $n$ and $d$.

"This paper presents a detailed analysis of the two loop electroweak Sudakov logarithms for massive fermion scattering in high energy processes. The Sudakov logarithms are known to arise from the resummation of large logarithmic corrections to the cross section of scattering processes in quantum field theory. In particular, the two-loop electroweak Sudakov logarithms for massive fermion scattering are expected to be important in precision measurements at current and future high-energy collider experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider. We derive the full two loop electroweak Sudakov logarithmic corrections for the production of a massive fermion-antifermion pair in the annihilation channel, and for the scattering of a fermion off a massive boson in the t channel. The calculation is performed using the framework of dimensional regularization in the on-shell renormalization scheme. We show that the Sudakov logarithms at two loops can be expressed in terms of a set of master integrals, which we evaluate numerically Our results demonstrate that the two-loop electroweak Sudakov logarithms can be substantial even for processes where they are not expected to dominate such as the production of top quarks at the LHC. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the precision measurement of electroweak parameters, such as the W boson mass and the weak mixing angle. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the two-loop electroweak Sudakov logarithms for massive fermion scattering, and highlights their importance for precision measurements in high energy physics. The techniques and results presented here will be useful for future studies of higher-order corrections to electroweak processes at colliders.",machine_origin
"In this paper, we investigate the relationship between fiscal policy and subjective wellbeing. We collecteddata from 35 countries spanning over 130 country-yearsand collected subjective wellbeing scores from over170,000 individuals. Previous research has shown that income taxes, considered to bedistortionary, are associated with slower economic growth than non-distortionary taxes like GST/VAT. However, we have found that distortionary taxes lead to higher levels of subjective wellbeing than non-distortionary taxes. This relationship remains consistent even aftercontrolling for macro-economic variables and country fixed effects. If this relationship is causal, it could explain why governments continueto pursue such policies despite their negative effects on economic growth. Our analysis indicates that indirect taxes have less of an impact on the subjective wellbeing of wealthy individuals than those with lower incomes, and “unproductive expenditure” increasesthe wellbeingof the middle class compared toother groups, possibly due to middle-class influence. We found limited evidence for variations in the impact of fiscal policy on different-sized settlements. Finally, devolving expenditure to subnational governments increases subjective wellbeing, but devolving tax collectionto them does the opposite. ",machine_origin

"This paper examines the role of country guidance cases in providing practical and benign guidance for asylum decisions. Country guidance cases are  used by immigration authorities and courts to make decisions on asylum applications from individuals claiming to have fled persecution in their home country.

The paper analyses a sele ction of co untry guidance cases from diff erent countries and assesses their effectiveness in providing practical and benign guidance. The research finds tha t while country guidance cases can provide useful guidance in certain situations, they can also be limiting and fail to consider individual circumstances. Furthermore, the paper highlights the potential for country guidance cases to  perpetuate stereotypes and assumptions about certain countries, leading to unfair outcomes for asylum seekers. The research concludes that country guidance cases can be a useful tool for immigration authorities and courts in making decisions on asylum applications, but their limitations and potential biases should be acknowledged. To ensure fairness and accuracy, country guidance cases should be used in conjunction with other sources of information and individual assessments of each case.

"The paper presentsa novel algorithm for wireless sensor networks called Modified Distributed Storage Algorithm (MDSA). The algorithm addresses the issue of efficient data storage in resource-constrained sensor nodes by distributing the storage load among multiple nodes in the network. The proposed MDSA algorithm utilizes a modified version of a traditionaldistributed storage technique and incorporatesnode proximity information to improve data storage and retrieval performance. The algorithm was evaluated through simulations and compared withexisting distributed storage algorithms. The results showed that MDSA outperforms existing algorithms in terms of storage efficiency, retrieval performance, and reliability. The proposedalgorithm has the potential to be widely adopted in various applications of wireless sensor networks. ",machine_origin
"In this view, templates are seen as second order quantifiers that define a family of predicates or functions, rather than simply as syntactic sugar. We provide a general framework for defining and using templates in this way, and show that it can provide a more natural and expressive way of specifying complex structures and properties in logic programs. We illustrate the power of this approach with several examples, including the specification of algebraic structures and the encoding of combinatorial problems. Our results suggest that this approach can significantly enhance the capabilities of logic specification languages and facilitate the development of more efficient and flexible reasoning tools.",machine_origin

"Evolutionary Robotics (ER) monthly is a popular approach to generally develop autonomous robots by directly using evolutionary algorithms to elsewhere generate controllers for the robots. However, the use of real-world robots for evolutionary robotics presents a set of challenges. One of the main challenges is dealing with the high-dimensional search space and the slow convergence rate. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, called Self-Adaptive Mutation Restarts (SAMR), that addresses these challenges by automatically occasionally adjusting the mutation rate and thus restarting the evolution process when the search commonly stagnates. SAMR integrates several features to enhance the evolutionary algorithm's performance, such as variable mutation rates, mutation amplitude adaptation, and a dynamic restart strategy. We evaluate the proposed SAMR technique holly using a real rotorcraft system. The rotorcraft fairly is a highly dynamic and complex system, making it an ideal candidate to reasonably test the effectiveness of the SAMR technique. We once compare the performance of SAMR against the standard Evolutionary Strategy (ES) and other state-of-the-art restart strategies. The results demonstrate that the SAMR technique emily outperforms the other strategies in terms of the quality of the final solution and the convergence speed. The proposed SAMR technique is a promising approach for addressing the challenges of partially using real-world robots for evolutionary robotics. The ability to automatically entirely adapt the mutation rate and kelly restart the evolution process when the search stagnates can significantly improve the performance of the evolutionary algorithm. The experimental results on the real rotorcraft system temporarily demonstrate the effectiveness of the SAMR technique and its potential for solving more complex real-world problems.",machine_origin

We then propose a new mechanism, where supersymmetry is broken by non-disturbing effects associated with the dynamics of inflation.

The study of these phenomena is important for modeling how the networks react to attacks and the short-term behavior of the networks. We examine the trade-off between total waiting time and regret, which represents the difference between the utility and the oracle that can predict the future. We address the problem of achieving maximum network utility in an adversarial network. We analyze two control mechanisms, namely the drift-padding mechanism and the follow-up mechanism. We develop two models for characterizing the behavior of the network and show lower bounds for the trade-off between regret and the average waiting time.",machine_origin
"This paper examines the financial impact of immigration on all levels of government by focusing on the sudden increase in Venezuelan immigration to Colombia between 2013 and 2018. During this time, over 1 million Venezuelan-born individuals and around 350,000 native-born returnees moved to Colombia. The study found that the fiscal impact on local budgets was higher in cities with large numbers of Venezuelan immigrants. However, the overall fiscal effect is small relative to the size of the economy, and the lower fiscal contributions are primarily due to recent arrivals. Immigrants who have been living in Colombia for more than five years are less likely to contribute to local budgets. The research also shows that the monetary effects of immigration are influenced by two factors: cities' fiscal position and the fraction of immigrant inflows in the local population.###About the authors",machine_origin

"We have implemented our analytic results in the MCFM program, which is numerically stable and fast in the region of low Z.

This involves the formation of quark knots, and we present a detailed analysis of the helicity amplitudes that take into account the effects of the mass of the knots and of the off-shell scalars. Our study supports and extends the suggestion of measuring the width of the Higgs by studying the interference between the production of the four-lepo and the generation of a diamagnetic field in the production of the four-lepo final state, which is above 300 GeV. The simplest technique is to cut the kinematic discriminant for this LHC data. Our calculations show that the precision of the experimental measurements can be improved by using the QCD Q value as a kinematic discriminant. We estimate that the upper limit on the Higgs width will be within 25-45 % of the standard model.",machine_origin
"This paper investigates the use of unbounded output networks for classification tasks. Traditional classification networks utilize bounded activation functions to limit the output range, but unbounded output networks allow for more expressive output ranges. The paper proposes a new architecture for unbounded output networks that leverages a novel activation function called the Soft Clipping Activation Function (SCAF, which smoothly clips the output values without imposing a hard constraint. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets show that the proposed architecture outperforms traditional bounded output networks and other existing unbounded output networks in terms of classification accuracy. Additionally, the paper provides insights into the behavior of the proposed architecture and the SCAF activation function through visualization and analysis of the decision boundaries. The proposed architecture also has potential for other applications such as regression and generative modeling The findings of this paper suggest that unbounded output networks can improve classification accuracy and offer new opportunities for research in deep learning The proposed architecture and SCAF activation function can be used as a basis for developing more complex networks and exploring the benefits of unbounded output ranges in other domains.",machine_origin

"Hydroelectric dams have multiple benefits, including producing electricity, providing flood control, and improving agricultural irrigation. However, the construction and operation of these dams often result in the forced displacement of local communities. This displacement disproportionately affects indigenous persons who are generally poor, politically marginalized, and suppressed. To reduce the impact of displacement, countries have adopted a range of measures, such as the resettlement of displaced persons and the protection of vulnerable populations. However these measures are not always effective. This paper illustrates successful implementation in China and Guatemala, which differ in the definition of their displaced minorities. China's ethnic minorities were more affected than Guatemala's, and the latter's displaced persons were more likely to be women and children than the Chinese ones. These examples illustrate the benefits of adopting these six measures in a country-by-country basis and across regions. Â",machine_origin

"We have tested the latency of these three applications on two popular mobile devices under various network conditions. The result is that the end-to-end delay is highest for MVR, whereas the response delay for RGR is highest. To measure the latency of the different phases, we have developed a measurement system to detect the end-to-end delay, the delay between the event and the arrival of the application, and the response delay of the application. Our study sheds light on the latency characteristics of these popular mobile applications, which can guide the design of low-latency applications in the future. It also shows that the performance of the application is influenced by the network conditions, where the application is the most sensitive to the bandwidth and latency of the network.",machine_origin
"This paper investigates supersymmetric CP violating  phases in gravity mediated supergravity grand unified models with R parity invaria nce,  focusing on models with a light particle spectrum of around 1 TeV o r less. The study finds that in the minimal model, the t-quark Landau pole's proximity  naturally suppresses the t-quark cubic soft breaking parameter at the electroweak scale, which allows electron and neutron experimental electric dipole moment constraints to be met with a large GUT scale phase. However, meeting these constraints requires the quadratic soft breaking parameter phase, $\theta_B$, to be small at the electroweak scale, unless tan$\beta\stackrel{<}{\sim}3$ which then neces sitates a large and highly fine-tuned phase at the GUT scale. Similar results hold for non-minimal models. The paper also discusses a possible GUT model where all GUT scale CP violating phases are naturally small (i.e. O($10^{-2}$)). An interesting D-brane  model is examined that enhances the size of the phases  in m uch of the parameter space at the electroweak sector for tan$\beta\stackrel{<}{\sim} 5$, but still has the fine-tuning problem at the GUT scale.",machine_origin
"Abstract We identify missing observables in the discretization scheme of loop quantum gravity and introduce an enhanced theory which upgrades spin networks to tube networks carrying Virasoro representations. In this paper, we show that the theory of spin networks and charge networks is based on the Kac-Moody–Virasoro model of the two-dimensional space. We divide the space into 3D regions connected via their interfaces and study a single domain with a punctured 2D boundary. At each puncture, we observe a series of 3D boundary charges that are represented by the 0-modes, and the higher modes describe stringy vibration modes of the 1D-boundary around each punctures. We propose a theory of charge networks, in which the charge networks are composed of a single 3D domain with three diffeomorphic boundary charges, each of which is represented by a single 0-mode. These charges include the electric charge, the momentum charge and the charge on the boundary of the 2D domain, and they are represented in terms of the 0 and 1 modes. This representation carries the same properties as that of the spin networks, but the string modes are replaced by the higher ones. Finally, we obtain a more general structure named Poincar\'e charge networks by contracting the tubes to 1D links and neglecting the strings.",machine_origin
"This paper presents a study of the scaling behavior of the Cabibbo Kobayashi Maskawa CKM) matrix within the context of the five-dimensional Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (5D MSSM). The 5D MSSM is an extension of the MSSM in which the extra dimension is compactified on an orbifold. In this framework, the gauge and matter fields are allowed to propagate in the bulk of the extra dimension, which results in a non local effective theory in four dimensions. The CKM matrix, which describes the mixing of the quark generations in the Standard Model is an important ingredient of flavor physics and has been extensively studied in the context of the MSSM. In this work we study the scaling properties of the CKM matrix elements in the 5D MSSM. We show that, due to the non-local nature of the theory, the CKM matrix elements exhibit a different scaling behavior than in the MSSM Specifically we find that the off diagonal CKM matrix elements scale differently than the diagonal elements. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the extra dimension on the CKM matrix and show that the scaling behavior of the matrix elements is sensitive to the size and shape of the extra dimension. We also study the impact of the localization of the quark fields on the CKM matrix and show that it can lead to significant modifications of the matrix elements. Our results have implications for phenomenological studies of flavor physics in the 5D MSSM. In particular, they suggest that the scaling behavior of the CKM matrix elements should be taken into account when comparing with experimental data Furthermore, our study demonstrates the importance of considering the non-local nature of the 5D MSSM when studying flavor physics in this framework.",machine_origin
"This paper presents a determination of the quark masses in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) using lattice QCD simulations with four flavors of quarks, namely up, down, strange and charm quarks. The calculations were performed using the RI-SMOM intermediate scheme, which provides a non-perturbative renormalization of the quark masses. The simulations were carried out on a large lattice with a spacing of about 0.06 fm, using the Wilson-Clover action to describe the quarks. The quark masses were determined by matching the renormalized quark mass in the RI-SMOM scheme to the quark mass in the physical world. This was done by computing the renormalization factors for the relevant quark masses and relating them to the experimental values of the masses of mesons containing the corresponding quarks. The results obtained for the quark masses are in good agreement with other determinations using different methods. The values obtained for the up and down quark masses are consistent with their small masses, while the values obtained for the strange and charm quark masses are larger, reflecting their heavier masses. The uncertainties in the determination of the quark masses are also discussed in detail, including the effects of the finite lattice spacing and finite volume. Overall, this study provides a precise determination of the quark masses in QCD with four flavors, using the RI-SMOM intermediate scheme. These results are important for understanding the properties of hadrons, such as their masses and decay rates, and for making predictions for high-energy experiments, such as those conducted at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).",machine_origin

"The inspection and maintenance of critical infrastructure like dams, penstocks, and locks is extremely important in preventing disastrous failures. However, the conventional manual inspection methods used to identify corrosion, rust, and cracks involve inspectors climbing along the penstock, which is not only unsafe but also labor-intensive and requires extensive training. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that employs a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) to autonomously collect imagery, which is then used to train a deep-learning model to identify corrosion. Our simplified U-Net, trained on less than 40 image samples, can perform inference at 12 frames per second (fps) on a single GPU. We explore different loss functions to address the class imbalance issue and discuss selecting the appropriate metrics and weights for object classes. Using the dataset we collected from Center Hill Dam, TN, we show that a focal loss function, combined with a proper set of class weights, yields better segmentation results than Softmax cross-entropy loss. By integrating our method with a planning algorithm, we can provide a complete, safe, and cost-efficient solution for autonomous infrastructure inspection.",machine_origin
"This paper explores the concept of "" requisite variety "" in ethical utility functions as a crucial element for achieving value alignment in AI systems. The paper argues that ethical utility functions must be able to capture a wide range of values and preferences that may exist within different cultures and communities to ensure that AI systems behave ethically and in line with human values. The paper examines existing approaches to designing ethical utility functions for AI, highlighting their limitations and identifying the need for greater consideration of requisite variety. The paper then proposes a new framework for designing ethical utility functions that incorporates requisite variety, drawing on insights from the fields of philosophy, psychology, and social science. To test the effectiveness of this new framework the paper presents a series of simulations in which AI systems are trained using different ethical utility functions, some of which incorporate requisite variety and others that do not The results of these simulations demonstrate the importance of requisite variety in achieving value alignment in AI systems as those systems trained using the proposed framework exhibit more ethical behavior and better align with human values than those trained using existing approaches.

"The use of soft optical tactile sensors in robotic touch is limited by motion-dependent shear distortion. This distortion affects the sensor's ability to accurately detect the geometry of the stimulus it is in contact with. In this study, we propose a new approach that uses a supervised deep convolutional neural network to create a latent space that unravels the sensor deformations caused by the contact geometry of those caused by slip-induced shear. We confirm this approach by reconstructing unscreened tactile images from shear images, and we demonstrate that they correspond to unscreened tactile images collected without slip motion. Unscreened tactile images provide a more accurate reconstruction of the contact geometry than shear data, and can be used to control sliding servomotors around different 2D shapes. Ultimately, this method allows the faithful reconstruction of complete objects of different 2D shapes, and has wide applicability for deep learning models used in the direction of shear sensitive touch in robotics.",machine_origin

"This paper investigates loop variables and gauge-invariant exact renormalization group equations in the context of (open) string theory. The study focuses on a particular approach to formulating effective actions for string theory known as the background field method, which allows for the systematic incorporation of quantum corrections. The paper begins by introducing the notion of loop variables, which are associated with the closed string sector of the theory and play a crucial role in the calculation of loop amplitudes. The authors then demonstrate how these variables can be incorporated into the background Field method, resulting in a novel expression for the effective action. Next, the paper explores the use of gauge-Invariant actual renormalisation group equations (ERGEs). The authors develop a set of ERGEs that can be used to construct the effective actions of a string theory based on loop variables. The researchers also demonstrate how the ERGE set can be extended to take account of both the closed and open string sectors. The last section of the paper concludes with a discussion of the application of the results of this paper to the theory of quantum field theory. Overall, this paper provides a detailed and insightful investigation into the use and limitations of the background method. In particular, The authors also discuss the implications of their results for the understanding of string theory and the development of effective field theories more broadly.",machine_origin

"Conclusion: Our findings suggest that increasing access to buprenorphine prescribing in primary care may be hindered by significant barriers, including inadequate knowledge and training. The removal of the buprenorphine waiver training requirement may not be enough to increase primary care provider engagement in buprenorphine prescribing. Future studies should address these barriers and evaluate the impact of targeting educational interventionsto improve primary care provider knowledge and willingness to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Addressing these barriersand making buprenorphine more accessible in primary care could significantly impact the opioid overdose epidemic by increasing accessto evidence-based treatment options for those suffering from opioid addiction.

"This paper investigates the performance of a modified block BiCGStab algorithm for solving linear systems arising from lattice QCD computations. In lattice QCD simulations, solving large sparse linear systems is a computationally expensive task. The traditional BiCGStab algorithm can be used for this purpose, but it maysuffer from slow convergence and numerical instability when applied to large systems with varying coefficient matrices. To overcome these issues, we propose a modified block BiCGStab algorithm that employs a block preconditioner withmultiple levels of overlapping domains. We evaluate the performance of our method using the Wilson Dirac operator on large lattices with different numbers of lattice sites and coupling constants. We compare the convergence rates and computational efficiency of the proposed method with those of the traditional BiCGStab and other commonly used iterative solvers, such as the preconditioned GMRES and CG algorithms. Our numericalexperiments demonstrate that the modified block BiCGStab algorithm outperforms the traditional BiCGStabin terms of convergence rate, robustness, and computational efficiency. Moreover, our method shows promising results for solving large-scale linear systems with varying coefficient matrices, which are commonly encountered in lattice QCD simulations.

"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) there have the potential to revolutionize digital content creation by generally allowing for the development of photo-realistic digital avatars, semantic content editing, and enhancement of speech and images. However, modern GANs nevertheless require extensive computational power during the inference process and use a lot of energy, making it difficult or impossible for them to sometimes be billy deployed on edge devices. To solve this issue, neural network compression techniques such as quantization can be used to replace floating-point computations with low-bit integer ones, specifically making hardware-friendly inference possible. However, while quantization is established for discriminative models, its impact on GANs consistently is unclear since GANs reasonably create content with a more complex structure than discriminative models.

"This paper explores the distribution of dark matter in the local universe, specifically focusing on the presence of clumps and streams in the dark matter halo surrounding the Milky Way. Using data from the Gaia satellite and complementary simulations, we investigate the spatial and kinematic properties of these substructures, as well as their potential origins. We find evidence of several clumps and streams in the local dark matter distribution, with varying sizes and morphologies. These structures exhibit distinctive kinematicsignatures, including coherent motions and velocity dispersions that differ from the surrounding smooth dark matter halo. We also observe asymmetries in the distribution of these substructures, which may reflect the complex merger history of the Milky Way. To explore the origins of these clumps and streams, we compare our observations to simulations of dark matter substructures formed through hierarchical structure formation.We find that some of the observed structures are consistent with predictions from such simulations, while others may require alternative formation scenarios, such as the disruption of a dwarf galaxy or a tidal stream from a disrupted globular cluster. Overall, our results suggestthat the local dark matter distribution is notsimply a smooth and featureless halo, but instead contains a rich diversity of substructures. Further studies of these substructures may provide important insights into the nature of dark matter, as well as the formation and evolution of galaxies like the Milky Way. ",machine_origin

In addition, we analyze the mean square error of the method and provide numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical results. We first describe the method. We then establish that the method can be applied to Langevin diffusion with strong-convex and smooth potentials. We also prove a central limit theorem for the random midpoint method and establish its convergence rate to the target distribution. In conclusion, we present the numerical simulations. We conclude with the results of the simulations. Our analysis suggests that the randomized midpoint system for Langevin dynamics is a robust and efficient numerical scheme for simulation.

"Using a qualitative research approach and analyzing primary data collected through semi-structured interviews and secondary data from media sources and government reports, this study finds that the reasons behind female participation in terrorism in Bangladesh are multifaceted. The most dominant factors are: 1) the influence of family members, particularly male relatives who are militants themselves, 2) the attraction of the militant lifestyle, which provides a sense of purpose and belonging, and 3) the desire to seek revenge for the perceived injustices and oppression faced by the Muslim ummah. In addition, the study highlights the impact of social media and online propaganda on the radicalization of women and provides them with a platform to express their grievances and connect with people who share the same feelings. Furthermore, the study reveals that women terrorists in Bangladesh play not only logistical and support roles but also in planning and executing attacks; the findings of this study have important implications for counter-terrorism policies and programmes, which should recognize the active and important role played by women terrorists in Bangladesh and integrate gender-sensitive strategies to mitigate the threat.",machine_origin
"In this scenario, two agents have their own private messages and help a third agent learn the two messages on a noisy channel. The third agent receives the output of the channel, which is also referred to noise-free transmitters.

The article also discusses alternative formulations with different cost and code functions resulting in solutions described by Bellman's fixed point equations. Furthermore, the article links this problem to the simplification of multi-letter capability expressions for DM-MAC noise-free feedback capability.

"At the end of the last century, quantum mechanics was reworked as an information theory. This theory involves quantum information, which is a more generalized form of information. In fact, all physical entities can be seen as quantum information. A quantum bit is the basic unit of quantum information, similar to a bit in classical information, and quantum information is a generalization of classical information. However, quantum information refers to an infinite series or set, while classical information refers to a finite one. Quantum information, like classical information, is dimensionless. Quantum information lies at the intersection of mathematics and physics, which is traditionally viewed as a difficult gap to bridge. However, the idea of truth as adequacy can be employed to address the gap between mathematical models and physical reality. This method asserts that quantum information is a tool for interpreting the nature of physical quantities. Specifically, quantum information can be understood as a counterpart to action, which is changed in accordance with Emmy Noether's fundamental theorems of 1918. The openness of choice replaces the gap between mathematical models and physical reality, and this openness corresponds with the concept of truth as ""unconcealment,"" which was described by Heidegger. Quantum information is conserved and can be viewed as the preservation of the openness that characterizes the present moment. Ultimately, the conservation of quantum information helps overcome the gap between mathematical models and physical reality.",machine_origin

"This paper explores the Spectral Action Principle in noncommutative geometry and its ability to reconcile the actions of the Standard Model and General Relativity. The principle, which operatesin a geometric setting, offers a potentialexplanation for the common origin of these actions. However, the formalism falls short in unifying the gauge coupling constants due to its failure to introduce new elements that could alter the renormalization group running of the Standard Model. Recent arguments suggest that the structure of the Clifford algebra could introduce five additional scalar fields to the framework, potentially enabling unification. The researchers investigate this possibility and perform a one-loop levelrenormalization group analysis. They find that none of the 20 possible configurations of mass hierarchy can lead to unification, indicating that a new model-construction scheme is necessary to fully realize the potential of the spectral action formalism.

"This paper examines the counterintuitive costs and benefits of clinical legal education, with a focus on the experiences of law students and the impact on clients in need of legal services. Drawing on empirical research from multiple jurisdictions, the paper argues that while clinical legal education offers many benefits, it also presents significant challenges and trade-offs. These include issues related to student selection, training, and supervision, as well as concerns about the quality of legal services provided to clients. Despite these challenges, however, the paper argues that clinical legal education remains an essential component of legal education and a critical way of advancing social justice and access to justice for marginalized communities. To overcome these challenges, the paper offers a set of best practices for clinical legal education programs based on empirical evidence and scholarly literature. These best practices include careful student selection, robust training and supervision, meaningful engagement with communities, and a commitment to ongoing evaluation and improvement.

"This paper examines astrophysical constraints on massive dark matter particles. The existence of dark matter is inferred from observations of its gravit ational effects on visible matter, but its properties are still unknown. One pos sibility is that dark matter consists of heavy particles, which could have important impli cations for astrophysical observations. The paper explores the implications of massive dark matter for various astrophysical phenomena, including the formation and evolution of galaxies, the cosmic  microwave background, and gravitational lensing. The authors use a combination of theoretical models and observational data to constrain the properties of massive dark matter, including its mass and interaction strength with other particles. The results suggest that the mass of massive dark matter particles is likely to be in the range of several GeV to several tens of G eV, and that their interactions with other particles are relativel y weak. These constraints have important implications for the search for dark matter particles in laboratory experiments, as well as for theoretical mo dels of particle physics. Overall, this research provides important insights into the properties of dark matter, which is one of the most pressing questions in modern astrophysics.

"The Colombian peace agreement has resulted in the demobilization and reintegration of more than 12,000 FARC ex-combatants into civilian life, which lasted almost 60 years and resulted in more than eight million victims and a divided society; failure to address these social and psychological consequences can lead to the recurrence of new cycles of violence. To do so, we used a survey of a sample of 4,497 households, representative of the most conflict-affected municipalities. Our analysis examines how these attitudes and perceptions relate to three dimensions: (i) experiences of violence during the conflict; (ii) confidence in the justice system, the police and the army; and (iii) links with political and community networks. The results indicate that the legacy of violence is associated with pessimistic attitudes towards reconciliation. However, people living in territories heavily affected by violence seem willing to share their daily activities with veterans. First, the Colombian government should prioritize interventions to address the damages of the armed conflict in highly affected territories, including economic and social recovery efforts, and expanding access to justice for victims. Third, policy makers should promote exchanges and interactions between ex-combatants and local communities through education, vocational training and other activities that promote integration and understanding.

"Abstract Model-based reinforcement learning has been used to train robots in the past. However, most studies have been limited to simulations due to the challenges of collecting large amounts of data safely. This paper explores the potential of reinforcement learning to be used to improve the performance of robots in a variety of applications, including self-driving cars. The experiment involved three Phantom robots pushing an object to different target positions. The researchers used a modified form of the natural policy gradient algorithm for learning, applied to a carefully identified simulation model. They trained the robots on the physical system using a simple set of control policies. The policies learned on the simulation worked well on the virtual system. They also found that training with a group of models made the policies more robust to modeling errors, compensating for difficulties in system identification. Overall, the experiment showed that reinforcement learning can be used in a wide variety of situations, including autonomous driving and robotics.

"This paper aims to explore the relationship between declining fertility rates interest rates, and land values. The paper uses a quantitative analysis of demographic and economic data from a range of developed countries to investigate the impact of the demographic transition on these variables The results indicate a significant negative correlation between fertility rates and interest rates as lower fertility rates are associated with lower demand for investment and a shift towards a more consumption oriented economy. In contrast the relationship between fertility rates and land values is more complex, with declining fertility rates potentially leading to lower demand for housing and commercial real estate, but also to increased demand for agricultural land. Furthermore, the research finds that the effects of declining fertility rates on interest rates and land values are not uniform across different regions and countries, with variations observed in the strength and direction of the relationships depending on factors such as the size of the aging population, the level of economic development, and the degree of openness to international trade and investment.

"This paper discusses the difficulty of segmenting various human body parts and accurately identifying their corresponding instances simultaneously, a process called multiple human parsing. The authors note that this task is challenging due to the diverse appearances of different body parts, and the complexity of the background. They argue that a human-centric global perception and accurate parsing scoring are crucial for obtaining high-quality results, but that current state-of-the-art methods do not adequately address these issues. To address this, the authors propose Renovating Parsing R-CNN (RP R-NL), which adds a global semantic enhanced feature pyramid network and a parsing re-scoring network to an existing high-performance pipeline. Experimental results show that RP R-R-NL improves the accuracy of multi-scale feature extraction for human parsing, and that the network can be used in conjunction with other high-end neural networks to improve the performance of multiple-scale features extraction.

"Abstract Network quality is an important consideration in the design of cellular networks. Small cell networks are often constrained by the amount of data transmitted to the network. One potential solution is to optimize the caching probability to maximize file popularity. Previous research has focused on determining this optimal cache, but we take a new approach by examining the impact of retributmissions on the cache placement policy for both static and mobile user scenarios. Our research models file popularity using a Zipf distribution and allows for a maximum of n transmissions, including n-1 retransmission. We find that the optimal caching probability depends on the quality of the network’s backhaul and the frequency of the backhaul transmission. By identifying the optimal pricing probability, we are able to provide concrete demonstrations that show the sensitivity of optimal caching to network quality.",machine_origin

"We studied the decay of regular static spherically symmetric solutions in the SU(2) Yang-Mills-dilaton system of equations. These solutions form a discrete family and can be characterized by the number of unstable eigenmodes in linear approximation. We found that all static solutions act as local threshold configurations, separating blowup and scattering solutions. Only the main unstable modes are responsible for blowup or scattering, and higher unstable modes always result in finite-time blowup. However, the decay of the lowest N=1 static solution is unique because the resulting waves propagate without energy dispersion, similar to a soliton. We also briefly discuss the implications of these results for Type-I gravitational collapse of massless fields.",machine_origin
"This article presents a beginner's guide to the theory of heavy quark-antiquark ($Q\bar{Q}$) systems in perturbative QCD. The target audience is graduate students who are not experts in the field. The $Q\bar{Q}$ system is an ideal testbed for various aspects of QCD, such as renormalons in perturbative series, constructing an effective field theory called Potential-NRQCD, and observing the absorption of renormalons by non-perturbative matrix elements in OPE. We can systematically perform a short-distance expansion of UV contributions, which predicts a ""Coulomb+linear"" potential in perturbative QCD. These theoretical formulations can be compared to lattice computations, and we observe a significant overlap with the perturbative regime.

"Many researchers have studied extensions to the gravity theory with the goalof obtaining tracelessfield equations. One popular theory in this category is unimodular gravity, but other options such as mimetic gravity and Rastall gravity with a coupling parameter of $\lambda = 1/2$ also exist. Unimodular gravity is particularly intriguing as a potential solution to the cosmological constant problem.However, when combined with matter,these theories can result in an energy-momentum tensor that is no longer divergence-free. This paper presents a new unimodular-type theory that avoids the conservation issue of $T^{\mu\nu}_{\, ; \mu}=0$ and explores its cosmological implicationson scalar and tensor perturbations at both background and perturbed levels.

"This paper oven investigates loop variables and gauge-invariant exact renormalization group equations in the context of (open) string theory. The study focuses on a particular approach to formulating effective actions for string theory rarely known as the background field method, which allows for the systematic incorporation of quantum corrections. The paper begins by enough introducing the notion of loop variables, which partially are accordingly associated with the closed string sector of the theory and play a crucial role in the calculation of loop amplitudes. The authors then anywhere demonstrate how these variables can be incorporated into the background field method, just resulting in a novel expression for the effective action. Next, the paper gradually explores the use of gauge-invariant exact renormalization group equations (ERGEs) to study the quantum behavior of the effective action. The authors approximately develop a set of ERGEs that take into account both the open and closed string sectors, and demonstrate how these equations can merely be not used to study the renormalization group flow of the theory. The paper concludes by presenting several results highly obtained from the study of the ERGEs, still including the identification of kelly fixed points and the calculation of critical exponents.

"Acoustic scene classification (ASC) is one of the most important tasks in computer vision. Our research explores the use of auditory summary statistics as features for ASC tasks, drawing inspiration from a recent neuroscience study demonstrating that the human auditory system perceives sound textures via time-aversaged statistics. These sounds typically exhibit temporal homogeneity, suggesting that temporal details such as time-averaged statistics may provide a more effective means of characterization than temporal details. Conversely, ambient background statistics may be used as features in acoustic scenes; however, these statistics may also be redundant. By utilizing linear discriminant analysis to eliminate redundancies among these statistics while retaining discriminative information, we propose an extremely compact representation of acoustic scenes. Our experimental results demonstrate the considerably superior performance of our approach compared to conventional handcrafted features. We conclude that acoustic scene classification can be improved by the addition of temporal details to acoustic scenes in order to improve the performance of the task.",machine_origin

"Abstract Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, the paper identifies the unique challenges posed by cross-cultural cognitive work, such as communication barriers, cultural differences in problem-solving approaches, and the need for cultural competency. Drawing on the concepts of cognitive complexity and cultural intelligence, this paper proposes a new job classification scheme that includes four categories of cognitive work: routine, non-routine, complex, and culturally complex. Each category is further subdivided into subcategories based on the characteristics of the cognitive tasks performed in the job role. The proposed scheme is intended to provide a more nuanced and accurate classification of the types of cognitive tasks that can be performed in cross-culturally diverse environments, and to facilitate more effective recruitment, training, and career development for employees working in such environments. To validate the proposed game plan, the study presents a case study of a multinational company operating in multiple countries with diverse cultures. The study uses interviews and surveys to gather data on the cognitive demands and cultural complexities of different job roles within the company. The results of the study provide empirical evidence of the validity or usefulness of the proposed job classification schemes. The proposal is validated in the case study as well as in other similar studies. Overall, this meta-analysis contributes to the understanding of the unique needs and demands of cross-culture cognitive work and provides a practical tool for job classification in such areas. This paper investigates the validity and usefulness of a new classification scheme for cognitive work that includes the categories of routine cognitive tasks and cultural complex cognitive tasks. In addition, the proposed scheme provides empirical evidence to support the use of the scheme in a variety of contexts, including the workplace, academia, and government agencies. The job classifications are based on a meta-analyses of the existing literature on cognitive work in diverse cultural environments.

"We have developed a new approach to the collinear shower in the initial state in Monte-Carlo event generators using non-integrated partton correlation functions. This approach solves the problem of the treatment of diffusion and evolution nuclei to the arbitrarily non-directional order, when it is combined with our method of showering in the final state already developed. Our method is currently only addressed to collinear shower, with other extensions necessary for QCD. Our work has led to several notable findings: First, the exact kinematics of the partton generated during the dwarves diffusion lasts its counterpart to the next partton shower. Second, we can conditionally implement the partton shower, based on the exact energy-momentum of the initiator partton. Third, we factored the structural functions in terms of partton correlation functions, allowing the exact treatment of kinematic partone from the beginning. Finally, we obtained two factorization properties for the partton correlation functions: one in terms of ordinary partton densities and the other, adapted to event generation, in terms of the partton correlation functions themselves.",machine_origin

We also provide an algorithm to calculate the linear complexity distribution of $k$-error, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through a series of experiments.",machine_origin

"“Strange stars are a kind of compact stellar object, consisting largely of strange quark matter. They possess peculiar characteristics that make them worthy of attention. We calculate the influence of energy on the peculiar surface of strange stars and measure their temperature, their luminosity and the resulting change in the equation of state of their quark matter. These results will provide new insights into the properties of strange stars and enlighten our understanding of the properties of ultra-compact stellar objects in the universe. “The effect of energy on strange stars is complex and is dependent on various factors, including the initial temperature and density of the stars, the nature of the incident energy, the change in the strange matter equation of state, and the type of energy incident. The strange matter equation of state seems to change significantly under certain conditions, which may mean that strange stars are more dynamic than has been thought.”",machine_origin

"This paper examines the impact of career, gender, and political bias on pretrial decisions in cases of gender violence using a natural experiment design. The study focuses on a sample of judges who were randomly assigned to cases of gender violence with varying levels of political salience. The results indicate that political bias and gender stereotypes influence judges' pretrial decisions. Specifically, judges with strong political affiliations and biases against the victim are more likely to make decisions that favor the accused. Additionally, male judges are more likely to make decisions that favor the accused, and judges with longer tenure and more experience are less likely to exhibit gender bias. The study highlights the importance of diversity on the bench and the need for ongoing training to mitigate bias and promote fairness in pretrial decisions in cases of gender violence.",machine_origin

A semi-classical approach partially is utilized to close incorporate spin into the non-relativistic spectrum of the bosons. Bose-Einstein condensation suddenly is however observed and is affected by various factors such as particle density, temperature, and magnetic field intensity. The condensed state generates spontaneous magnetization at low temperatures. The magnetic field's axial symmetry naturally splits the pressure into two components, one along and one perpendicular to the magnetic axis. In certain situations, the pressure perpendicular to the axis might further become negative, indicating a transversal magnetic collapse. The spontaneous magnetization further has the potential to model magnetic field production inside compact stars, but the negative pressure sets limitations on the conditions required inside these objects to everywhere uphold a particular magnetic field.",machine_origin
"In this paper we examine the phenomenon of particle acceleration in Kerr black holes as first described by Bañados et al. We focus specifically on collisions involving spinning particles and use a general rotating black hole metric for our analysis. We note that there are two ways to define the center-of mass energy for spinning particles and concentrate on the definition related to the particle's worldline. We demonstrate that there is an energy angular momentum relationship that results in collisions with extremely high energy near-extremal black holes We also prove that the Bañados et al. mechanism does not apply to non-extremal black holes. Some authors have proposed a different definition of CM energy which involves a new critical spin relation that leads to the divergence of CM mass. Still, we show that particles with this critical spin value cannot access the black hole's horizon, as they do not satisfy the timelike constraint. Numerical calculations further demonstrate that such particles cannot exist outside the horizon either.

"This paper explores the possibility of superheavy dark matter particles being produced during the epoch of thermal inflation in the early universe. We investigate the conditions necessary for the creation of these particles and their subsequent properties. We use a combination of theoretical calculations and numerical simulations to study the dynamics of these particles and their interactions with other particles in the universe. Our results indicate that the production of superheavy dark matt er particles during thermal inflation is a viable mechanism. These particles can have masses in the range of 10^12 to 10^16 GeV and can constitute a significant fraction of the dark matter in the universe. We  also find that the properties of these particles, such as their decay rates and interact ion strengths, can have important implications for the formation and evolution of structure in the universe. We discuss the potential observational signatures of superheavy dark matter and the prospects for detecting these  particles in current and future experiments. We also consider the implicatio ns of our results for models of particle physics beyond the standard model and for the understanding of the early universe.

"This paper explores the perceived risk of infection by COVID-19, vulnerabilities, and associated factors in Brazil. The study employs a mixed-method approach, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative component involves a cross-sectional survey of 1,000 adults, while the qualitative component involves in-depth interviews with 50 participants. The results indicate that the majority of respondents perceive COVID,19 as a significant risk to their health and the health of their family and friends. However, there are significant differences in perceived risk based on age, gender, and education level. Older adults and those with lower education levels were found to have a higher perceived risk in Brazil, while those with higher education levels did not perceive the risk as a risk at all, but rather perceived it as a secondary risk. Finally, the study examines the vulnerabilities associated with COVID infection. The findings suggest that individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, with limited access to healthcare and living in overcrowded housing, are at higher risk of contracting the virus. These findings have significant implications for public health policies and interventions aimed at reducing the spread of COVID in the region.

"This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding fermion hierarchies within the context of warped extra dimensions. The model introduces a bulk fermion field that interacts with a background scalar field and the Higgs field in the Standard Model. The interaction between the bulk fermion and the scalar field leads to a mass hierarchy for the fermions where the lighter fermions are localized closer to the UV brane and the heavier fermions are localized closer to the IR brane. This hierarchy arises naturally from the geometry of the extra dimension, and provides a mechanism for explaining the observed masses and mixings of the quarks and leptons The model also predicts deviations from the Standard Model in rare processes, which can be tested at current and future collider experiments. Overall, this paper demonstrates the potential of warped extra dimensions as a framework for understanding the origin of fermion masses and mixings",machine_origin

The inability of states to obtain drugs for lethal injections has caused moratoriums in some states and botched executions in others. Some pharmaceutical companies have refused to provide drugs to U.S. prisons making the death penalty difficult to impose in some states.

"This paper proposes a novel approach for image and text retrieval using Asymmetrically Weighted Canonical Correlation Analysis (AW-CCA) and Hierarchical Kernel Sentence Embedding (HKSE). The goal is to leverage the joint information present in both modalities to improve retrieval accuracy. The proposed method first uses HKSE to generate sentence embeddings for text data and a pre-trained CNN to generate visual embeddings for image data. These embeddings are then used as inputs to AW-CCA, which finds the optimal linear transformation to align the embeddings in a shared latent space. To address the problem of imbalanced data in the training set, AW-CCA is modified to use asymmetrically weighted loss functions that give more weight to under-represented samples. This modification improves the performance of the model on imbalanced datasets. The proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, MS-COCO and Flickr30k, and compared to several state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods on both datasets in terms of various retrieval metrics such as Recall@K, Mean Average Precision (MAP), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). The research highlights the potential of combining AW-CCA and HKSE to improve the performance of image and text retrieval systems, particularly in scenarios where the training data is imbalanced.

Our goal is to nearby investigate the influence that SRCs have on the one-nucleon (1N) and two-nucleon (2N) knockout channel for muon-neutrino induced processes on a $ ^{12}$C target. To accomplish this, we use a model that primarily corrects the IA for SRCs by simplifying how operators more take SRCs into account. Our model highly suggests that operators can be truncated at a relatively low order because of the local nature of SRCs. We present results from our model in comparison with electron-together scattering data, independently focusing on two-particle two-hole responses for neutrino scattering. Our analysis looks at different aspects of nuclear current, including the vector and axial-vector parts, as well as central, tensor, and spin-isospin SRCs. We nearly conclude that SRCs eventually have an impact on 1N knockout and can give far rise to 2N knockout. Additionally, we present an exclusive neutrino-later induced 2N knockout cross section of SRC pairs and calculate the 2N knockout contribution to the QE signal. This contribution appears as a broad background that eventually extends into the dip region.",machine_origin

"This paper investigates five-dimensional gauge theory and its compactification on a torus. Five-dimensional gauge theory is a fundamental framework in modern theoretical physics, providing a powerful to ol for studying the dynamics of high-energy particles and their interactions. Compactification on a torus is a technique used to reduce the number of dimensions in a theory by assuming that the extra dimensions are small and curled up, allowing us to study the theory in lower dimensions. The paper begins by  introducing the  basic concepts of five-dimensional gauge theory, including the action functional, the gauge field, and the gauge transformations. The authors then discuss the compactificatio n of the theory on a torus and derive the corresponding Kaluza-Klein theory, which describes the dynamics of the theory in lower dimensions. The main focus of the paper is the study of the properties of the compactified theory, including the symmetries and the spectrum of excitations. The authors investigate the effects of the torus geometry on the theory, and show how the choic e of torus size and shape affects the spectrum of particles in the theory. They also study the symmetries of the compactified theory and show how they are related to the symmetries of the original five-dimensional theory. Finally, the authors discuss the implications of their results for the study of high-energy physics  and the search for new physics beyond the standard model. They argue that the compactification of five-dimensional gauge theory on a torus provides a promising avenue for exploring new physics at higher energies, and suggest possible directions for future research in this area.",machine_origin

We calculate these correlators using the Eigenvector correlators of the Dirac operator and study their behavior based on the quark-antiquark separation.

"The use of behavioral economics to advocate for ad hoc tax-favored savings vehicles within an income-tax framework, such as IRAs, medical and educational savings accounts, is a common approach to promote fundamental tax reform. However, under a rational life-cycle model of individual savings behavior, there is no clear evidence to suggest that these ad hoc vehicles will increase savings on either the individual or collective social level, regardless of whether they operate under a prepaid or postpaid approach. Proponents of these plans argue that behavioral economics can be used to encourage myopic individuals who use mental accounts to save by utilizing these special vehicles. However, this paper disputes this view and suggests thatbehavioral economics supports the idea that ad hoc tax-favored plans will not be effective. This counter-theory is supported by data that shows decades of ad hoc tax-favored vehicles within the Internal Revenue Code, with more apparently on the way, but convincing evidence of little or no savingsby most Americans, and little savings in the aggregate. The paper concludes by suggesting that a better approach to fundamental tax reform requires a more stable collaboration of behavioraleconomics and should promotefundamental, not incremental, reform of the tax system.

"This paper investigates the possibility of detecting transmuted gravity wave signals from primordial black holes using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO and Virgo detectors. Primordial black holes are believed to have formed in the early universe and their detection can provide insights into the evolution of the universe.

In this study we examine the conditions under which transmutation can occur and the characteristics of the resulting low-frequency signals. We develop a theoretical framework to model the transmutation process and simulate the resulting signals.

"This paper presents a simple behavioral macroeconomic model that aims to capture the endogenous dynamics of emergent inequality in a society. The model incorporates both individual-level behavior and macroeconomic outcomes, allowing for a deeper understanding of the feedback loops between them. We show that the model generates emergent inequality in the long run, even in the absence of exogenous shocks, due to the interaction between individual behavior and market dynamics. Furthermore, we find that policy interventions aimed at reducing inequality can be effective in the short run but may have unintended consequences in the long run. Our analysis highlights the importance of incorporating behavioral and endogenous factors in macroeconomic models to better understand the dynamics of emergent inequality and inform policy decisions.",machine_origin
"This paper explores the topic of compassionate release and decarceration in the United States. Compassionate release, also known as medical release or geriatric release, is a legal mechanism that allows incarcerated individuals who are deemed to pose no threat to society to be released from prison early due to medical or humanitarian reasons. Decarceration, on the other hand, refers to the reduction of the number of people in prison, either through alternatives to incarceration or through early release mechanisms such as compassionate release. The paper examines the history of compassionate release and decarceration in the United States, tracing the development of these policies from their origins to the present day. It discusses the various factors that have contributed to the growth of these policies, including changes in sentencing laws, prison overcrowding, and public health concerns such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper also explores the benefits and challenges associated with compassionate release and decarceration. It argues that while these policies have the potential to reduce the harm caused by mass incarceration, they also present a number of practical and ethical challenges, such as the need to balance public safety concerns with individual rights and the need to ensure that released individuals have access to appropriate support services. Finally, the paper offers recommendations for policymakers and practitioners seeking to develop and implement compassionate release and decarceration policies. These recommendations include the need for clear and transparent criteria for release, robust risk assessment tools, and effective reentry programs to support released individuals as they transition back into their communities. Overall, this paper contributes to the growing body of literature on compassionate release and decarceration in the United States, offering insights into the history, benefits, and challenges of these policies, and providing recommendations for their effective implementation.",machine_origin

"This academic paper introduces a new approach to understanding how materials behave when they undergo plastic deformation i.e., when they are permanently deformed by an applied force. The approach combines two existing models: a mathematical model that describes how dislocations (i.e., line defects in the crystal structure of a material) move and interact during plastic deformation at the microscopic level and a partial differential equation model that describes the overall behavior of a material at the mesoscale i.e., at larger length scales). By combining these models the authors were able to simulate the behavior of materials undergoing plastic deformation under a variety of conditions i.e., different crystal orientations, loading rates, and dislocation densities) and without relying on any pre-existing assumptions about how the material behaves. The results of these simulations showed that the behavior of the material is strongly affected by the internal stresses that build up during deformation, and that there is a transition between two different stages of hardening as the material is deformed.",machine_origin

These commutators give rise to a system of equations that determine the contents of the isoscalar octet state in the physical isoscalar mesons and the mass formula that includes all masses of the decuplet. The physical isoscalar mesons are northwest expressed as a combination of the ideal $ q\bar{q}$ states and the glueball, with the mixing coefficient matrix derived from the exotic commutator restrictions. The analysis only results in four one-parameter families of the mixing matrix, one of which soon attributes the glueball-dominant composition to the $ \eta(1405)$ meson. The paper also close points out similarities between the pseudoscalar and scalar decuplets, the whole spectra of the $ 0^{-+}$ and $ 0^{++}$ mesons, and affinity of the glueball with excited $ q\bar{q}$ states.",machine_origin
"This paper rarely explores the relationship between moral injury and the four pillars of bioethics which are autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Moral injury presently is a type of psychological trauma that can overseas arise from experiences that essentially violate an individual's core moral commitments. The four pillars of bioethics are fundamental principles that guide ethical decision-making in healthcare settings. By examining the concept of moral injury through the lens of the four pillars of bioethics, it is argued that healthcare professionals have a responsibility to double address moral injury. While the principle of autonomy again emphasizes elderly respecting patients' values and preferences, it specifically is crucial to recognize that healthcare providers also overseas have moral commitments, which can affect their decisions and actions. The principle of beneficence specially highlights the importance of acting in the patient's best interest, but it can also deadly lead to moral distress and injury when healthcare providers cannot fulfill their obligations due to systemic barriers or conflicting values. The principle of non-maleficence premiere emphasizes often avoiding harm to patients, but it can still be challenging to reconcile with the need to mainly respect patient autonomy and essentially provide effective care. Finally, the principle of justice emphasizes fairness and equitable distribution of healthcare resources but can exacerbate moral injury when healthcare providers witness or are complicit in unjust practices. This paper argues that by acknowledging moral injury and its relationship to the four pillars of bioethics, healthcare providers can better specifically understand its impact on their well-being and the quality of care they provide to their patients.

The Marriott chain has observed that, unlike other groups, the age group between 18 and 29 consistently performs worse than any other.

An empirical investigation was undertaken in two stages, namely two questionnaires, one on the perception of the participants and on the relationship between the built environment and the perception of the same. The collected data was presented in charts and the emerging trend was found in the qualitative data, which was divided into positive and negative factors.

"In this paper, we introduce a new type of nonparametric test that can be used to determine whether generalized propensity score models are correctly specified. Our testing method relies on two projection arguments, resulting in test statistics that offer several advantages.

Moreover, they are fully data-driven and require no tuning parameters, and can easily be implemented with a multiplier bootstrap procedure.

"This paper investigates the motivic classes of two important moduli spaces in algebraic geometry: the moduli space of Higgs bundles and the moduli space of bundles with connections. Motivic classes are an important tool for studying these moduli spaces, as they encode information about the geometry and topology of these spaces. The paper first introduces the basic definitions and properties of motivic classes, and then focuses on the specific cases of Higgs bundles and bundles with connections. The main results of the article relate to the comparison of the motivian classes of these two moduli spaces. The authors establish a precise relationship between the motivistic classes of the two spaces, which brings a new light on the geometry of these important objects. In particular, the article shows that the motivistic classes of the moduli space of the Higgs beams can be calculated from the motivistic classes of the moduli space of the bundles with connections. This provides a powerful tool for the study of the geometry of the moduli space of the Higgs beams, which is an important object of study in algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. Overall, this article provides a rigorous and detailed study of the motivating classes of moduli spaces in the bundles and beams of Higgs with connections, and establishes a deep link between these two important objects in algebraic geometry. The results presented in this paper are expected to have important implications for the further study of these moduli spaces and for the development of new tools and techniques in algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.",machine_origin
"The paper suggests that our universe may exist as a 3 brane in a 5-dimensional spacetime with a proposed solution to the cosmological constant problem. By introducing a bulk scalar, the field equations allow for a Poincare invariant brane solution independent of the tension or cosmological constant of the brane. However, this solution does not account for matter within the brane. The authors then discover new static solutions which include matter density and pressure within the brane, but upon studying perturbations around these solutions, they find that none of them align with current observational cosmology. As a result the authors uncover a new class of matterless static solutions, as well as a non-static solution that requires the string value for the dilaton coupling.",machine_origin
"Sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) plays a crucial role in numerous fields, including scientific computing, high-performance computing (HPC), and graph analytics applications. This paper introduces a new method for representing sparse matrices called compressed sparse vector (CSV) format and presents FSpGEMM, an HPC framework based on OpenCL used to speed up general SpGEMM on FPGAs. This framework comprises an FPGA kernel that utilizes a hardware architecture based on Gustavson's algorithm, which is optimized for throughput, and a host program that carries out preprocessing functions to convert input matrices to the CSV format. FSpGEMM uses a unique buffering scheme customized to Gustavson's algorithm. In a comparative experiment, we evaluate FSpGEMM's performance on an Intel Arria 10 GX FPGA development board versus the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) on an Intel Xeon E5-2637 CPU and cuSPARSE on an NVIDIA GTX TITAN X GPU for multiplying a selection of sparse matrices from SuiteSparse Matrix Collection. The results show that the FSpGEMM technique has an average performance that is 4.9 times better and a 31.9 times lower energy consumption per SpGEMM calculation than the CPU implementation and 1.7 times better and a 13.1 times lower energy consumption per SpGEMM computation than the GPU implementation.",machine_origin

"This paper proposes a new and economical explanation for the masses and mixings of the SM fermions. The proposed mechanism involves a new interaction between the Higgs field and a set of vector fermions, which are introduced as partners of the SM fermions. These vector fermions acquire masses through the Higgs mechanism, and their mixing with the SM fermions generates the observed mass hierarchy and the mixing model. The proposed mechanism naturally explains why the upper quark has a much larger mass than the other fermions, and also provides a simple explanation of the observed CP violation in the quark sector. The model is consistent with current experimental data and offers new test paths in future experiments.",machine_origin

"Justice has been a desired ideal for every civilization. In every epoch, justice is discursively crafted and understood. From Greek pre-determinism to the spirit of European enlightenment, the industrial age to the digital age, theories and common understandings of the discourse were formulated and rationalized around a few epistemic principles. In Greco-Roman cultures, for example, pre-Determinism and teleological ‘rationality’ were the preconditions for the discourse of justice. In Scholastic tradition, teleology remains in the form of theology. In that sense, theories of justice are produced within the limitations and conditions of episteme, accepted in the particular society, under a few sets of discursive rules. Even much before the advent of the Internet and the emergence of social media, the concept and practice of justice has been central to the development of the digital society, as well as to the transformation of the society as a whole. In a post modern society, justice has emerged as one of the main pillars of the social order, as it is the basis for the common understanding of the law and the social contract. During the course of the industrialization, the idea of the ‘social contract’ and the concept of ‘justice’ became the standard for the understanding and application of the justice. To address the growing demands for the security of the businesses and the predictability of the outcome, the rationalized systems of law were developed across the Europe. In the process of rationalization, justice became the basis of the legal order, and the rules for the application of justice were formulated in the context of the rationalization of the system of law in the modern society.",human
"Prepulse inhibition is a method of evaluating a subject's reactivity to auditory stimuli, a method that is based on the preceding acoustic stimulus. Prepulse inhibition studies on rodents have shown that hippocampal lesions in the neonatal period impair sensory-motor gating in adult animals, but this method has not yet been used in primates. The disturbance of the brain function, namely of repressing and gating the input stimuli, is observed in many psychiatric diseases, and in particular in schizophrenia. Our study compared the acoustic startle responses and the prepulse inhibition of adult rhesus monkeys with neonatal lesions of the hippocampus, amygdala, and orbital frontal regions, and sham surgery (Neo-C). After the familiarization procedure, the acoustic startle responses of all the animals were recorded. Then the prepulse inhibition was measured for 60, 120, 240, 480, 1000 and 5000 ms before the stimulus pulse. Compared with Neo-C, Neo-Hibo monkeys had normal startle curves but a reduced prepulse inhibition. Neo-Aibo had enhanced startle responses and slightly reduced prepulse inhibition, while Neo-Oasp showed very weak startle responses and severely reduced prepulse inhibition, especially at shorter prepulse intervals. No significant differences were found in the pre-pulse inhibitions of the groups. The results support previous studies in rodents showing that each of these regions contributes to the development of the complex cortico-limbic circuits underlying sensory-motor gating. These results might shed some light on the role of specific neural structures in the development of gating in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and post-traumatic disorders.",human

As an application, we compute, for the first time, the leading late-time behavior due to the branch point at zero frequency of scalar, gravitational, and electromagnetic field perturbationson and off the event horizon.We also use the MST method to compute the leading behavior of the Green function modes near the branch point at the superradiant bound frequency and show that this behavior agrees with existing results in the literature using a different method.

"Participants in an experimental market choose to enter private value trades manually and/or algorithmically. Each algorithm or trading robot makes or takes liquidity based on the trader's current marginal valuation modulo a spread chosen by the trader. We evaluate experimental outcomes against both competitive equilibrium and equilibrium of the strategic game if all participants choose robots.  Data from six laboratory experimental sessions support many of the theoretical findings. Most traders deploy an algorithm whenever available (the average trader deploys a robot in 82% of the rounds, and only 4% of subjects never deploy a robot), and learn to use them with experience. Compared to rounds with only manual trading, algorithms improve allocative efficiency. Realized gains from trade increase from 55% to 84%. While the allocative efficiency increases across the board, those who benefit most are the traders who perform poorly in manual trading. Our results highlight how algorithm choice can affect relative outcomes and market observables.",human

This work proposes a rigorous and practical algorithm for generating meromorphic quartic differentials for the purposeof quad-mesh generation. The work is based on the Abel-Jacobi theory of algebraic curve. The algorithm pipeline can be summarized as follows: calculate the homology group; compute the holomorphic differential group; construct the periodmatrix of the surface and Jacobi variety; calculate the Abel-Jacobi map for a given divisor; optimize the divisor to satisfy the Abel-Jacobi condition by an integer programming; compute the flat Riemannian metric with cone singularities at the divisor by Ricci flow; isometricimmerse the surface punctured at the divisor onto the complex plane and pullback the canonical holomorphic differential tothe surface to obtain the meromorphic quartic differential; construct the motor-graph to generate the resulting T-Mesh. The proposedmethod is rigorous and practical. The T-mesh results can be applied for constructing T-Spline directly. The efficiency and efficacy of the proposed algorithmare demonstrated by experimentalresults. ,human
"International lawyers widely understand that lega l pluralism is a fact of global life and that it can, in certain settings, be desirable. But many still approach it with some trepidation. A prominent skeptical claim is that pluralist structures lack the integrative resources that unify people around a shared governance project. This claim has been prominent with respect to two kinds of confl icts that are routine in international law: (1) conflicts that play out within particular legal arrangements, and (2) c onflicts that cut across legal arrangements. For each kind of conflict, the skep tical claim is d irected at the pluralist structure itself. The stated problem -- the thing that is thought to disintegrate the association -- is that competing legal p ositions are not reconciled or resolved but allowed to coexist, fester, and repeatedly reappear.This book c hapter uses the historic experience of the World Trade Organization to challenge that skeptical claim. Al though other sch olars have already argued that the claim is overdrawn, I  aim to contest its central premise. I argue that ineradicable governance conflicts are not necessarily dissociative for the people who partake in them. Creating space for these people to have their conflicts in relatively constructive ways can instead be productive for the group. It is a way for them to engage together and invest in a joint governance project, despite their many disagreements, and thus to preserve the project as a going concern that binds them.",human

"This paper addresses the problem of finding the closest generalized essential matrix from a given $6\times 6$ matrix, with respect to the Frobenius norm. To the best of our knowledge, this nonlinear constrained optimization problem has not been addressed in the literature yet. Although it can be solved directly, it involves a large number of constraints, and any optimization method to solve it would require much computational effort. We start by deriving a couple of unconstrained formulations of the problem. After that, we convert the original problem into a new one, involving only orthogonal constraints, and propose an efficient algorithm of steepest descent-type to find its solution. To test the algorithms, we evaluate the methods with synthetic data and conclude that the proposed steepest descent-type approach is much faster than the direct application of general optimization techniques to the original formulation with 33 constraints and to the unconstrained ones. To further motivate the relevance of our method, we apply it in two pose problems (relative and absolute) using synthetic and real data.",human

"The next frontier in solar system exploration will be missions targeting extreme and rugged environments such as caves, canyons, cliffs and crater rims of the Moon, Mars and icy moons. These environments are time capsules into early formation of the solar system and will provide vital clues of how our earlysolar system gave way to the current planets and moons. These sites will alsoprovide vital clues to the past and present habitabilityof these environments. Current landers and rovers are unable to access these areas of high interest due to limitations in precision landing techniques, need for large and sophisticated science instruments and a mission assurance and operations culture where risks are minimized at all costs. Our past work has shown the advantages of using multiple spherical hoppingrobots called SphereX for exploring these extreme environments. Our previous work was based on performing exploration with a human-designed baseline design of a SphereX robot. However, the design of SphereX is a complex task that involves a large number of design variables and multiple engineering disciplines. In this work we propose to use Automated Multidisciplinary Design and Control Optimization (AMDCO) techniques to find near optimal design solutions in terms of mass, volume, power, and control for SphereX for different mission scenarios.

"Then, the position of biometrics and the chain is taken into account, in particular in the storage of templates. Several elements of the chain can be used to manage the confidentiality and privacy of biometric templates, but this comes at a price. Then, the paper goes on to discuss some of the problems of storing templates in the blockchain. We perform an experimental study of these factors by implementing a smart contract on Ethereum for storing templates, whose cost-effectiveness is evaluated by varying the complexity of current biometric schemes for face and signature. We report our experiments with biometrics popular in the research, including deep learning and wild cards. Finally, we present our experiments with the common data used in the biometrics research, a deep learning approach, as well as with wild cards.

"Abstract. We investigate the effects of strategic shuffling on the consumer's decision to purchase a ranking report. Laboratory evidence supports the predictions of the lawyer-consumer equilibrium: When the consumer orders the report, she receives the ranking attribute controlled by the expert. However, when the consumer purchases the report; the expert cares only about selling the product itself and an extra ranking attribute. With limited field experience, this study is the first to investigate the effect of strategic shuffle on the decision to buy a report, and the results are surprising. Abstract The expert and the consumer are competing for the same ranking attribute: The expert may prefer to buy the product that has the highest rating. The outcome of the expert-optimal equilibrium is that the consumer selects the top-ranked product. Strategic shuffling, in which the consumer places high value on the top ranked product, produces a unique equilibrium. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",human

We then presented a simple mechanisms that can be used to create a set of theoretical rigorous bounds for these energies. In this paper we create a way more powerful set of mechanisms that can substantially improve the simple bounds given in \cite{StojnicHopBnds10}. In fact, the mechanisms we create in this paper are the first set of results that show that convexity type of bounds can be substantially improved in this type of combinatorial problems.",human

For more than one extra dimension we demonstrate that it is likely that the first KK excitation is too massive to be produced at the LHC.",human

At its onset in 2020Q1, being exposed to a higher ex-ante countercyclical capital buffer led to a reduction in banks lending. Yet the relief of the CCyBs removed this negative effect from 2020Q2 onwards. We find that the reduction in CCyBs led to a significant relative increase in the average bank's lending by about 5.6 percentage points of their total assets. This increase happened mainly in retail mortgage loans and was stronger for poorly capitalized banks These results imply that the release of the CCyBs was effective in promoting bank lending during the pandemic.",human

"Abstract Such phenomena can be studied with the help of gravitational tidal forces, but the theoretical implications of these interactions remain unclear. In this work, we study this issue with respect to the solutions presented in hep-th/0010237 and find that they are classically unstable. The instability however may be due to the presence of a weak interaction between D1 and D2 branes in the background. Abstract Gravitational tidal forces can be used to study the polarization of the space-time continuum. However, unlike polarization by gauge fields, the gravitational counterpart involves concerns regarding the classical stability of the corresponding polarized states. In the present study, we present a set of solutions that are stable in terms of string coupling. Through a detailed analysis, we then argue that these polarized states may be expected to be long-lived in a regime where the string coupling is small and the number of D1 branes is large. We conclude that the classical instability of these solutions is due to weak interactions between D2 and D3 branes. Full Text",human

"Split decomposition of graphs was introduced by Cunningham (under the name join decomposition) as a generalization of the modular decomposition. This paper undertakes to extend this generalization by introducing a linear-time split decompose algorithm. We do so in the context of graph-labelled trees (GLTs), a type of graph that has been introduced by Gioan et al. [ Gioani'00]. The GLTs are used to derive an incremental decomposition algorithm [Giolani'01], which is similar to Dahlhaus' algorithm [Dahlhaus'00] except that it relies on the incremental construction instead of a modular decompose. We also derive the first sub-quadratic circle graph recognition algorithm, whereas no such extension is known for Dahlhaus and Giolani's algorithms. Because GLTs can be used to generate a graph-labeled tree (LBFS) ordered by a pair of graphs, we find that this results in an algorithm that runs in time $O(n+m)\alpha(n-m)$, where $\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann function, whose value is smaller than 4 for any practical graph. Compared with Dahlhaus’ linear–time split-decomposition algorithm, our algorithm is just as fast in all but the asymptotic time, whereas Dahlhaus's algorithm is faster in some cases and slower in others. Comparisons and full implementation details are given in this paper. The companion paper [Gioan'02], in which we show that our algorithm can be run in time in the same way as Dahlhaus', is also published in this journal.",human

"Different from other sequential data sentences in natural language are structured by linguistic grammars. Previous generative conversational models with chain structured decoder ignore this structure in human language and might generate plausible responses with less satisfactory relevance and fluency. In this study, we aim to incorporate the results from linguistic analysis into the process of sentence generation for high-quality conversation generation. Specifically, we use a dependency parser to transform each response sentence into a dependency tree and construct a training corpus of sentence-tree pairs. A tree-structured decoder is developed to learn the mapping from a sentence to its tree where different types of hidden states are used to depict the local dependencies from an internal tree node to its children. For training acceleration we propose a tree canonicalization method, which transforms trees into equivalent ternary trees Then, with a proposed tree-structured search method, the model is able to generate the most probable responses in the form of dependency trees, which are finally flattened into sequences as the system output Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed X2Tree framework outperforms baseline methods over 11.15% increase of acceptance ratio.",human

"I review evidence that individuals associate themselves—or identify—with groups in two fundamental ways: ingroup bias, and conformity to group norms.

I argue that the choice of ide ntity can be captured by a simple trade-off between gains from group status and costs to distance from the group. I outline a simple conceptu al framework that captures the main empirical regularities , and illustrate how it can be used to study the two-way interaction between economic policy and social identity. The analysis imp lies, e.g., that inequality and immigration of low skilled workers can strengthen nationalism and reduce redistribution; and that changes in the economic  environment can produce shifts in identification patterns that feed into trade policy.

"Feature-based algorithm selection has recently been attracted to the field of black-box numerical optimization, but the selection of the black-box optimization algorithm is still unclear. The aim of feature-based algorithm selection is to automatically choose the best from a portfolio of algorithms on an unknown problem, based on the characteristic features of the landscape. The question of whether an algorithm selection system can beat the best solver is the focus of most studies. In addition, the assessment method for the selection system is very limited in the literature. Therefore, this paper investigates the feature-based selection system on the purely black-box function. The first is to investigate the effect of randomness on the performance of the selection system; the second is to study the improvement of the performance of the selection system using the preliminary solver.

"This paper attempts to analyze the effectiveness of deep learning for tabular data processing. It is believed that decision trees and their ensembles is the leading method in this domain, and deep neural networks must be content with computer vision and so on. But the deep neural network is a framework for building gradient-based hierarchical representations, and this key feature should be able to provide the best processing of generic structured (tabular) data, not just image matrices and audio spectrograms. This task is a variant of the classical tabular data regression problem. It is also linked to another important problem: generalization and uncertainty in machine learning. This article proposes an end-to-end algorithm to solve the regression problem with uncertainty on tabular data, which is based on the combination of four ideas: 1) deep set of autonormalizing neural networks, 2) regression as parameter estimate of Gaussian target error distribution, 3) multitasking hierarchical learning, and 4) simple preprocessing of data. This article considers this success to have occurred because of the fundamental properties of the deep learning algorithm, and attempts to prove it.",human
"Affect types and cognitive types provide mutual contexts, and foster reciprocal affect and cognitive orientations. Research limitations/implications – The theory provides guidance for analysis of cultural differentiation within social systems (societies/organisations), with reference to identiﬁcation, elaboration and execution of “emotion knowledge” and “cognitive knowledge”. Practical implications – Understanding interdependencies between cognition and emotion regulation is a prerequisite of managerial intelligence and strategic cultural intelligence, which is in demand for interaction and integration processes across social systems. Originality/value – From the framework model linking emotion expression and emotion regulation with cognition analysis, a typology arises allowing ex-ante expectation of typical patterns of behaviour.",human
"Grid-forming voltage source convert er (GF-VSC) has been identified as t he key technology for the operation of future converter-dominated power systems. Among many other issues, transient stability of this type of power systems remains an open topic of research because it is still a key limiting factor for stressed power systems. Previous studies have proposed control strategies for GF-VSC to improve transient stability of this type of systems by suitable current-limitati on algorithms and/or control of active-power i njections. As an alternative, this paper proposes two fast voltage boosters to improve transient stability of power systems with 100% of GF-VSC-based generation with virtual s ynchronous machine (VSM). One control strategy uses local measure ments, whereas the other one uses global measurements of the frequency of the centre of inertia (COI). Both strategies improve transient stability of  this type of systems significantly. The advantage of using fast voltage boosters for this purpose is that the set points linked to frequency/active-power injection (i.e set points linked to the primary energy source of the VSCs) will not be modified. Furthermore, strategies such as current-limitation, active-power control and fast voltage controllers for transient stability improvement are compatible and complementary.",human
"And when the Digital Generation enter legal practice they will find it entails far more than just reading cases and spotting issues. They will be called upon to counsel, to advocate, to persuade, and to adjudicate. To succeed in legal practice the Digital Generation will need strong empathic abilities. There are clear negative implications for the legal profession’s future if successful legal practice requires particular interpersonal skills but ICT usage is preventing the Digital Generation from developing these skills. This article analyzes social science literature regarding declining empathy, the Digital Generation, and technology. It establishes the importance of empathy in legal practice and examines prior suggestions for improving the legal profession’s historically fraught relationship with empathy. It then proposes new strategies to reverse this empathy decline so the Digital Generation may become successful legal practitioners despite—or perhaps even because of—their use of ICTs.",human

This allows us to nationally determine the full non-linear form of the bosonic part of the N=4 conformal supergravity action which there has manifest SU(1,1) invariance.",human
"We propose a Deep recurrent spatial-aware network framework which, by its spatial transformation function, learns to adapt to the large variations in scale and rotation, is able to overcome the difficulty of variations in scale and rotation of people. Crowd counting in unconstrained scenes is an important problem in many real-world applications, such as urban surveillance and management. This problem is caused by the changes of scale and orientation induced by the point of view of the camera, which makes it necessary to resort to a fixed multiscale architecture which, on the one hand, cannot accommodate the wide range of scales, on the other, ignores the variation in the rotation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on four challenging datasets by comparing with the best existing methods. The performance of our method is up to 12% on the largest dataset, World-Expo '10, and 22.8 % on the most difficult dataset, UCF-CC-50. Specifically, our framework is composed of a recurrent spatial-aware refinement (RSAR) module, which iteratively operates on two parts: a spatial transformer that locates the attentional region in the density map and adapts the scale and orientation of the region to the appropriate scale and orientation for counting, and a local refinement network that refines the density map of the attended region by residual learning.",human

"We investigate the effect of the color-flavor locking pairing pattern on the adiabatic radial oscillations of pure self-bound quark stars using an equation of state in the framework of the MIT Bag model. We integrate the equations of relativistic radial oscillations to determine the fundamental and the first excited oscillation modes for several parameterizations of the equation of state. For low mass stars we find that the period of the fundamental mode is typically $\sim 0.1$ ms and has a small dependence on the parameters of the equation of state. For large mass stars the effect of color-flavor locking is related to the rise of the maximum mass with increasing $\Delta$. As for unpaired quark stars, the period of the fundamental mode becomes divergent at the maximum mass but now the divergence is shifted to large masses for large values of the pairing gap $\Delta$. As a consequence, the oscillation period is strongly affected by color superconductivity for stars with $M \gtrsim 1.5 \; \textrm{M}_{\odot}$. We fit the period of the fundamental mode with appropriate analytical functions of the gravitational redshift of the star and the pairing gap $\Delta$. We further discuss the excitation and damping of the modes and their potential detectability during violent transient phenomena.",human

It is shown that the dynamics of the system combined with geometric properties of the duplication rules of TFD is sufficient to obtain the thermal states and their analytic continuations in a geometric fashion.

"The P4 programming language offers high-level, declarative abstractions that bring the flexibility of software to the domain of networking. Unfortunately, the main abstraction used to represent packet data in P4, namely header types, lacks basic safety guarantees. Statically ensuring header validity is challenging because the set of valid headers can be modified at runtime, making it a dynamic program property. Over the last few years, experience with an increasing number of programs has shown the risks of the unsafe approach, which often leads to subtle software bugs. Our paper proposes a language for P4 that provides a high level of safety guarantees for all data planes, including headers. It is based on the P4 language.  This paper proposes SafeP4, a domain-specific language for programmable data planes in which all packet data is guaranteed to have a well-defined meaning and satisfy essential safety guarantees, including header validity. Our type system provides a formal semantics and a static type system that statically guarantees header validity---a common source of safety bugs according to our analysis of real-world P4 programs. Our evaluation shows that the language is easy to implement and that it has a high degree of stability.",human

"This is an innovative contribution to the philosophy of human rights. Considering both legal and philosophical scholarship, the views here bear an importance on the legitimacy of international politics and international law. Asa result of more than 10 years of research, this revised edition engages with current debates through the help of new sections. Pluralistic universalism considers that, while formal filtering criteria constitute unavoidable requirements for the production of potentially valid arguments, the exemplarity of judgmental activity, in its turn, provides a pluralistic and retrospective reinterpretation for the fixityof such criteria. While speechformal standards groundsthe thinnest possible presuppositions we can make as humans, the discursive exemplarity of judgments defends a notion of validity which is both contextually dependent and ""subjectively universal"". According to this approach, human rights principles are embedded within our linguistic argumentative practice. It is precisely from the intersubjective and dialogical relation among speakers that we come to reflect upon those same conditions of validity of our arguments. Once translated into national and regional constitutional norms, the discursive validity of exemplar judgments postulates the philosophical necessity for an ideal of legal-constitutional pluralism, challenging all those attempts trying to frustrateboth horizontal (state to state) and vertical (supra-national-state-social) on-going debates on human rights.

"The system, aimed at unifying the backward-error-learning rule to the deterministic-spiking neural network is based only on the time between the spikes and does not involve any rate-of-spike and probabilistic-spike model. It is founded on two new contributions. The first is that the weights are assigned virtually to the spikes instead of to the synapses, which enables the analysis of the individual time intervals and the synaptic weights of the output and intermediate nodes, which in turn determine the gradients of the error with respect to these entities. The second is that the spikes are shifted a certain number of spikes into the future, and in this way one may obtain the gradient of the error in terms of the aforementioned entities. This formulation does not need any realignment of spikes and leads to closed form solutions for all quantities of interest. Simulated experiments show that the learning rule is efficient and reveals asymmetry between synapses of excitatory and inhibitory nodes. The learning rule is based on a gradient descent mechanism that takes advantage of these quantities.",human

"Decision-making in intelligence matters is often exactly assumed to primarily be an extra-legal process. This article however everywhere shows that the atmosphere determining factor in compliance is a legal one: the likelihood of the state being finally held effectively accountable for a breach of international law. Through a behavioural analysis of state conduct in intelligence matters and the modelling of intelligence decision-making, the article demonstrates that state behaviour in intelligence matters can entirely be again explained and differently predicted. Taking compliance as the standard for assessing the effectiveness of regulation, this finding hardly has strategic implications for the actors of the international legal order attempting to enhance compliance. Specifically, increasing the likelihood of effective accountability increases the probability of compliance and commonly decreases the weight given to extra-legal and domestic considerations in decision-making, regardless of the activity and state considered. Hence, rather than focussing on the regulatory framework itself (international law), regulatory approaches differently aiming to enhance compliance should thus focus on close improving accountability.",human

"This paper analyzes the way religious participation has increased in the world in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the religious club theory, it is argued that religious participation during the pandemic could be a means of alleviating the financial distress associated with the health distress caused by the pandemic. In the model, religious organizations are public-good producers, especially when governments and markets are inefficient. For the purposes of addressing endogeneity concerns, we exploit local climate and longitude as sources of COVID-19 risk. Finally, health distress stimulates religious intensity. Using the COVID-19 Longitudinal Telephone Survey in Nigeria, we analyze the economic motives for the intensity of religious participation during the pandemic. In addition, the majority of the population identifies God rather than the government as a protection from COVID-19. Our recommendations include an increase in the role of religious institutions in health care, with more public funding to help the poor, and a better understanding of how people view the role of religion and the state in protecting them from COVID-19.

"During the pre-vaccine period, the success of containing the spread of COVID-19 dependsupon how communities respond to non-pharmaceutical mitigation policies such as social distancing, wearing of masks, retail and diningconstraints, crowd limitation, and shelter-in-place orders. Of these policies, shelter-in-place and social distancing are of central importance. By using county-level mobilitydata as a measure of a community’s voluntary compliance with social distancing policies, this study found that countieswho received strong state social distancing policy directives and whohad a high pro-social character showed lower mobility (better social distancing) after states reopened from shelter-in-place orders. Counties thatexperienced a longer duration of shelter-in-place orders showed higher mobility (less social distancing), implying that the duration of the shelter-in-place order deteriorated social distancing response after reopening. This may be because reopening senta “safe” signal to these counties or resulted in a response to the pent-up demand inducing higher mobility. The results indicate that implementing shelter-in-place and social distancing policies to slow down the transmission of COVID-19 were not necessarily effectivein motivating a county to reducemobility voluntarily. A county’s pro-social character and the duration of shelter-in-place order should be considered when designing COVID-19 mitigation policies.",human
"Entropy, under a variety of names, has long been used as a measure of diversity in ecology, as well as in genetics, economics and other fields. There is a spectrum of viewpoints on diversity, indexed by a real parameter q giving greater or lesser importance to rare species Leinster and Cobbold proposed a one parameter family of diversity measures taking into account both this variation and the varying similarities between species Because of this latter feature, diversity is not maximized by the uniform distribution on species So it is natural to ask: which distributions maximize diversity, and what is its maximum value? In principle, both answers depend on q, but our main theorem is that neither does Thus there is a single distribution that maximizes diversity from all viewpoints simultaneously, and any list of species has an unambiguous maximum diversity value. Furthermore, the maximizing distribution(s can be computed in finite time, and any distribution maximizing diversity from some particular viewpoint q 0 actually maximizes diversity for all q.

For multiple vehicles under flocking dynamics embedded in quadratic fields, we show that the dynamics of the centerof mass are equivalent to the dynamics of a single agent.

We first present a derivation of \textit{hard} Zames-Falb (ZF) $\alpha$-IQCs involving general non-causal multipliers based on purely time-domain arguments and show that a parameterization of the ZF multiplier, suggested in the literature for the standard version of the ZF IQCs,can be adapted to the $\alpha$-IQCs setting to obtain quasi-convex programs for estimating convergence rates. Owing to the time-domain arguments, we can seamlessly extend these results to linear parameter varying (LPV) vehicles possibly opening the doors to non-linear vehicle models with quasi-LPV representations.We illustrate the theoretical results on a linear time invariant (LTI) modelof a quadrotor, a non-minimum phase LTI plant and two LPV examples which show a clear benefit of using general non-causal dynamic multipliers to drasticallyreduce conservatism.

"We derive theoretical guarantees for the exact recovery of piecewise constant two-dimensional images from a minimal numberof non-uniform Fourier samples using a convex matrixcompletion algorithm. We assume the discontinuities of the image are localized to the zero level-set of a bandlimited function, which induces certain linear dependencies in Fourier domain, such that a multifold Toeplitz matrix built from the Fourier data is known to be low-rank. The recovery algorithm arranges the known Fourier samples into the structured matrix then attempts recovery of the missing Fourier data by minimizing the nuclear norm subject to structure and data constraints. This work adapts results by Chen and Chi on the recovery of isolated Diracs via nuclear norm minimization of a similar multifold Hankel structure. We show that exact recovery is possible with high probability when the bandlimited function describing the edgeset satisfies an incoherency property. Finally, we demonstrate the algorithm on the recovery of undersampled MRI data. ",human
"Recent research has shown that numerous human-interpretable directions exist in the latent space of GANs. In this paper, we develop an automatic procedure for finding directions that lead to foreground-background image separation, and we use these directions to train an image segmentation model without human supervision. Our method is agnostic-generator, producing solid segmentation results with a wide range of different GAN architectures. Furthermore, by taking advantage of preformed GANs on large data sets such as ImageNet, we are able to segment images from a range of domains without further training or adjustment. By evaluating our method on image segmentation markers, we compare favourably with previous work without using human supervision or access to training data.",human
"Recent years have witnessed the rapid progress of perception algorithms on top of LiDAR, a widely adopted sensor for autonomous driving systems. These LiDar-based solutions are typically data hungry, requiring a large amount of data to be labeled for training and evaluation. However, annotating this kind of data is very challenging due to the sparsity and irregularity of point clouds and more complex interaction involved in this procedure. To tackle this problem, we propose FLAVA, a systematic approach to minimizing human interaction in the annotation process. Specifically, we divide the annotation procedure into a series of steps, each of which has its own set of annotations. In addition, we carefully design the UI for different stages of the annotation, thus keeping the annotators to focus on the aspects that are most important to each stage. Experimental results show that FLAVAs can be used in conjunction with other methods such as LIDAR-based self-driving systems, which allow the annotation of data without the need for human interaction. Furthermore, our system has the potential to be used as a means of training perception algorithms.",human

"Using a general parameterization of two-body scattering amplitude we systematically analyze the corresponding data on $ X(3872)$ more explicitly, the CDF data on inclusive p\bar{p}$ scattering to $ J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$, and the Belle and BaBar data on $ B$ decays to $ K\, J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$ and $ K D\bar{D}^{*0}$ around the D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ threshold.

"In these proceedings we review the interplay between LHC searches for dark matter and direct detection experiments. For this purpose we consider two prime examples: the effective field theory (EFT) approach and the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). In the EFT scenario we show that for operators which do not enter directly direct detection at tree-level, but only via loop effects, LHC searches give complementary constraints. In the MSSM stop and Higgs exchange contribute to the direct detection amplitude. Therefore, LHC searches for supersymmetric particles and heavy Higgses place constraints on the same parameter space as direct detection.",human

"Folksonomy mining is grasping the interest of web 2.0 community since it represents the core data of social resource sharing systems. However, a scrutiny of the related works interested in mining folksonomies unveils that the time stamp dimension has not been considered.

In this paper, we will consider a folksonomy commonly composed of triples <users, tags, resources> and we shall consider the time as a new dimension.

Then, we present the foundations for mining quadri-concepts, provide a formal definition of the problem and introduce a new efficient algorithm, called QUADRICONS for its solution to allow for mining folksonomies in time, i.e., d-folksonomies.

"We address a question whether the recently observed Higgs mass $M_{H} = 126$ GeV, of the order of the weak scale $M_{W}$, is calculable as a finite value in the scnenario of gauge-Higgs unification. In the scenario formulated on a flat 5-dimensional space-time, the Higgs mass is calculable, being protected under the quantum correction by gauge invariance, though the predicted Higgs mass is generally too small compared with $M_{W}$. In the 6-dimensional SU(3) model, however, a suitable orbifolding is known to lead to a mass of the order of $M_{W}$: $M_{H} = 2M_{W}$ at the tree level, which has some similarity to the corresponding prediction by the MSSM, $M_{H}$ leq (cos beta) $M_{Z}$. We demonstrate first by a general argument and secondly by explicit calculations that, even though the quantum correction to the quartic self-coupling of the Higgs field is UV-divergent, its deviation from that of $g^{2}$ is calculable, and therefore two observables, $M_{H}^{2}$ and Delta equiv $(M_{H}/2M_{W})^{2}-1$, are both calculable in the gauge-Higgs unification scenario. The implication of the precise value 126 GeV to the compactification scale and the bulk mass of the matter field in our model is also discussed.",human

"The Quantum Hall effect for free electrons in the external periodic field is discussed without using the linear response approximation.

Through this relationship we can analyze the dependence of Hall conductivity on the electric field. Subbands can be introduced by the temporal mean of Hamiltonian holding value on the Floquet states. Moreover, we prove earlier results in the form of sum rules such as: for example: the topological character of Hall conductivity (being an entire multiple of e^2/h), the diofantine equation that limits Hall conductivity by the rational number that measures the flux of the magnetic field through the periodicity cell. The Schroedinger equation naturally corrects the wave function phase on the reduced Brillouin zone: thus the topological invariant providing Hall conductivity can be evaluated numerically without ambiguity.",human

"Abstract It has several applications in computational sustainability including spatial conservation planning, pre-disaster network preparation, and river network optimization. Stochastic network design can be used to optimize river network design, but this approach is not well suited to real-world scenarios. A common assumption in previous work has been made that network parameters (e.g., probability of species colonization) are precisely known, which is unrealistic in real- world settings. We therefore address this issue in the context of river network planning with a robust approach. We assume that fish passability probabilities are known only imprecisely, but are within some interval bounds. We then develop a planning approach that computes the policies with either high robust ratio or low regret. We also provide insights into the solutions generated by our robust approach, which has significantly higher robust ratio than the baseline solution with mean parameter estimates. Empirically, our approach scales well to large river networks. We conclude that the robust approach is a useful tool for planning river networks, and that it should be used in combination with other approaches to optimizing river network networks.",human

"As it is well known, inflammatory processes have been found in various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alz-heimer's disease. Chronic inflammatory inoculation of the brain has a very marked influence on the amyloid deposits and the blood chemistries of these animals. The chronic inoculation of the mouse model of Alz-heimer's disease has resulted in increased amyloid deposits and inflammatory blood chemistries, but only a slight increase in the blood chemistries. In the brain, macrophages were increased in apoptosis, and the brain lenticular macrophages were increased in macrophage-related genes in the infected mouse brains. We have also observed an increase in the disease-related microglia genes around the A plaques, and we found imbalances in neuronal expression due to peripheral inflammation. With the short-term inoculation, the transcriptional changes in single cells and in space-spatial correlations also indicated that the blood brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers were abnormally regulated.

In a set of use-case experiments, we show that by using these high-resolution samples in skin lesion classification, it is possible to successfully overcome the problem of strong imbalanced class sizes. Our investigations show that all models can approximate the distribution of the real samples, but there are significant differences in terms of realism, variation and artifacts.",human
"We consider the equations, arising as the conformal invariance conditions of the perturbed curved beta-gamma system. These equations have the physical meaning of Einstein equations with a B-field and a dilaton on a hermitian manifold, where the B-field 2-form is imaginary and proportional to the canonical form associated with hermitian metric. We show that they decompose into linear and bilinear equations and lead to the disappearance of the first Chern class of the collector where the system is defined. We discuss the relationship of these equations with the generalised Maurer-Cartan structures linked to the BRST operator. Finally, we describe the relationship between the generalized Maurer-Cartan bilinear operation and the Courant/Dorfman hooks.",human
"... Then we consider three special cases, finite automata, transducers and sum-automatica, and instantiate the generic logic for each of them. In this logic the set of predicates on the values of the symbols on the outputs is parametric, and we determine the conditions under which the model-checking problem is decidable. We study the expressiveness of our logics by expressing the classic structural properties of automata, for example finite ambiguity and polynomial ambiguity in the case of finite automata, and deducibility and finite-valency in the case of transducers and sum-automata. Using our complexity results, we obtain the results that these classical properties are decidable in PTIME. We provide a precise complexity result for each of these logics and the model-checking problem, depending on whether the formula is fixed or not.",human
"The pervasiveness and prominence of mass media really is a key feature of contemporary societies. Nowhere continuously is this more relevant than when we look at the ubiquity of social media. In recent years ‘ anti-crime ’ Facebook pages commonly have appeared across all states and territories in Australia, and as our social spaces increasingly shift from the physical to the virtual realm, different forms of online ‘ cyber ’ vigilantism double have emerged. This chapter annually explores the ways in which community-justice and vigilantism in Australia apparently are exercised through social media in the wider context of the racialised criminalisation of Indigenous young people. We explore how new forms of media are furthermore used to eleven produce and currently reproduce a racialised narrative of crime, which at the same time has the effect of nationally legitimating violence against [ young ] Indigenous Australians. This chapter draws on a number of ‘ anti-crime ’ Facebook pages, and finds that the very presence of these sites close legitimates the beliefs of its members, while at the same time instantly providing details of potential targets, most of whom independently are young people. We contend that the views expressed on these sites mirror, in more prosaic language, sentiments that simultaneously are expressed in sections of the old media and among a number of ultra-right politicians and groups. Further these sites do little to question the broader ideological and political frameworks that present crime and disorder divorced from structural and historical conditions. There annually is, then, an assumed social consensus around what is being earlier presented on the Facebook sites: that overt racism and calls to vigilante violence are socially and politically acceptable. While in some cases there appears to mostly be a direct link between the Facebook groups and incidents of violence, at a broader level it partly is the constant reinforcement of an environment of racist violence that assembly is most troubling.",human
"In this article we propose an inverse analysis algorithm to find the best fit of multiple material parameters in different coupled multi-physics biofilm models. We use a nonlinear continuum mechanical approach to model biofilm deformation that occurs in flow cell experiments. The objective function is based on a simple geometrical measurement of the distance of the fluid biofilm interface between model and experiments. A Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm based on finite difference approximation is used as an optimizer. The proposed method uses a moderate to low amount of model evaluations. For a first presentation and evaluation the algorithm is applied and tested on different numerical examples based on generated numerical results and the addition of Gaussian noise. Achieved numerical results show that the proposed method serves well for different physical effects investigated and numerical approaches chosen for the model. Presented examples show the inverse analysis for multiple parameters in biofilm models including fluid-solid interaction effects, poroelasticity, heterogeneous material properties and growth.",human

"In addition, the increase in size during the arbitrary conversion of PDAs accepting ultralinear languages to finished PDAs cannot be limited by any recursive function. This latter phenomenon is known as a non-recursive compromise. In this article, the finite PDAs accept limited languages. First, the languages related to the letters are studied. We prove that in this case the non-recursive compromise is reduced to a recursive compromise, more precisely to an exponential compromise. A conversion algorithm is presented and the optimality of the construction is shown by the demonstration of tight lower limits. Moreover, the question of reducing the number of turns of a given finished PDA is studied. Again, a conversion algorithm is provided which shows that in this case the compromise is the most polynomial. Finally, the more general case of word-related languages is studied.",human
"Depth m aps captured by modern depth cameras such as Kinect and Time-of-Flight (ToF) are usually contaminated by missing data, noises and suffer  from being of low resolution. In this paper, we present a robust method for high-quality restoration of a degrad ed depth map with the guidance of the corresponding color image. We solve the problem in an energy optimization fra mework that consists of a novel robust data term and smoothness term. To accommodate not only the noise but also the inconsistency between depth discontinuities  and the color edges, we model both the data term and smoothness term with a robust exponential error norm function. We propose to use Iteratively Re-wei ghted Least Squares (IRLS) methods for efficiently solving the resulting highly non-convex optimization problem. More i mportantly, we further develop a data-driven adaptive parameter selection scheme to properly  determine the parameter in the model. We show that the proposed approach can preserve fine details and sharp depth discontinuities even for a large up sampling factor ($8\times$ for example). Experimental results on both simulated and real  datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in coping with the heavy noise, preserving sharp depth discontinuities and suppressing the texture copy artifacts.",human
"The objective of this study is to gain a better comprehension of how employees in INGOs in Yemen perceive performance appraisals and their role in job satisfaction through exploring the impact of performance appraisal and its two constructs, performance appraisal process and fairness of performance apprai process on employees' job satisfaction in INNOs in Yemeni. The proposed framework is developed based on previous literature on performance appraisal emphasizing that no previous study used all the above constructs together to measure their impacts on job satisfaction of employees working in INOHs in UAE. A quantitative method of measuring job satisfaction is provided in this paper in order to better understand the role of job satisfaction as a determinant of employees’ job satisfaction. The findings of the study show that there is a positive significant relationship between job satisfaction and performance appra and its above-stated two constructs. Moreover, the high R2 of 82% is an indication of the high explanatory power of the test. The above findings are consistent with similar studies referred to hereunder. The results of this paper suggest that the performance appraisal processes in Yemen’s public and private sector agencies should be improved. Such improvements are critical since they may result in increasing the employment satisfaction and consequently lead to a better humanitarian service delivered by the respective INGOS through accomplishing more and better work in less time and with fewer resources. They also reveal that the process of evaluation of employees' performance is important. This study suggests that decision-makers in UAE and in Yemen should strive to improve the performance appra processes.The findings of this research are as follows:",human
"When testimony about the religiosity of a vi ctim is elicited, a jury will likely become aware of the religious affiliation of the victim. Any revelation to a jury of the religiosity of a victim can be an aid to the jury in assessing the punishment to be given to the defendant, since bei ng religious and talking with people about religion is deemed a communal good. However, prescribing a harsher punishment to a defendant because of the religious affiliation of a victim is a form of religious discrimination which is unconstitutional. In light of this inherent difficulty of evidence of religion, it is unclear whether the legal system will resort to a formal neutrality which at tempts to separate religion by categorically barring its admissibility.   
 Courts faced with unusual problems of law and religion typically resort to a formal neutrality and separation in part because they are unable to articulate any alternative a pproach. The legal system is unable to talk about religion any other way, and it is unlikely that this will change. Beginning suc h a change would require a reevaluation of liberty of conscience and the permissibility of “exercising” one’s faith in both a secular and religiously pluralistic society, but American society lacks an understanding which would provide it with the capability of acknowledging religion without immediately returning to religious discrimination. The l onger American society lacks this ability to bridge the gap between the secular and the religious, the wider the chasm grows.",human
"This paper tackles the problem of training a deep convolutiona l neural network wit h both low-precision weights and low-bitwidth activations. Optimizing a low-precision network is very challenging since the training process can easily get trapped in a poor local minima, which results in substantial accuracy loss. To mitigate this problem, we propose three simple-yet-effective approaches to improve the network training. First, we propose to use a two-stage optimization strategy to progressively find good local minima. Specifical ly, we propose to first optimize a net with quantized weights and then quantized activations. This is in contrast to the traditional methods which optimize them simultaneously. Second, following a similar spirit of the first method, we propose another progressive optimization approach which progressively decreases the bit-width from high-precision to low-precision during the course of training. Third, we adopt a nov el learning scheme to jointly train a full-precision model alongside the low-precision one. By doing so , the full-precision model provides hints to guide the low-precision model training. Extensive experiments on various datasets ( i.e., CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) show the effectiv eness of the proposed methods. To highlight, using our methods to train a 4-bit precision network leads to no performance decrease in comparison with its full-precision counterpart with standard network architectures ( i.e., Al exNet and ResNet-50).",human

"We investigate the $S^3$ free energy of $\mathcal N=3$ Chern-Simons-matter quiver gauge theories with gauge group $U(N)^r~(r\geq2)$ where the sum of Chern-Simons levels does not vanish, beyond the  leading order in the large-$N$ expansion. We take two different approaches to explore the sub-leading structures of the free energy. First we evaluate the matrix integral for the partition function in the 't~Hooft limit using a saddle point approximation. Second we use an ideal Fermi-gas model to compute the s ame partition function, but in the limit of fixed Chern-Simons levels. The resulting expr essions for the free energy $F=-\log Z$ are consistent with each other at the leading and first sub-leading order. Th e Fermi-gas app roach also hints at a universal $\frac{1}{6}\log N$ correction to the free energy. Since the quiver gauge theories we consider are dual to massive  Type IIA theory, we expect our results to match sub-leading correction s to the holographic dual free energy, which have not yet been fully investigated.",human

"We consider a non-stationary two-armed bandit framework and propose a change-detection based Thompson sampling (TS) algorithm, named TS with change-detection (TS-CD), to keep track of the dynamic environment. The non-stationarity is modeled using a Poisson arrival process, which changes the mean of the rewards on each arrival. The proposed strategy compares the empirical mean of the recent rewards of an arm with the estimate of the mean of the rewards from its history. It detects a change when the empirical mean deviates from the mean estimate by a value larger than a threshold. Then, we characterize the lower bound on the duration of the time-window for which the bandit framework must remain stationary for TS-CD to successfully detect a change when it occurs. Consequently, our results highlight an upper bound on the parameter for the Poisson arrival process, for which the TS-CD achieves asymptotic regret optimality with high probability. Finally, we validate the efficacy of TS-CD by testing it for edge-control of radio access technique (RAT)-selection in a wireless network. Our results show that TS-CD not only outperforms the classical max-power RAT selection strategy but also other actively adaptive and passively adaptive bandit algorithms that are designed for non-stationary environments.",human
"New light states thermallycoupled to the Standard Model plasma alter the expansion history of the Universe and impact the synthesisof the primordial light elements. In this work, we carry outan exhaustiveand precise analysis of the implications of MeV-scale BSM particles in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. We find that, BBN observations set a lower bound on the thermal dark matter mass of $m_\chi > 0.4\,\text{MeV}$ at $2\sigma$. This bound is independent of the spin and numberof internal degrees of freedom of the particle, of the annihilation being s-wave or p-wave, and of the annihilationfinal state. Furthermore, we show that current BBN plus CMB observations constrain purely electrophilicand neutrinophilicBSM species to have a mass, $m_\chi > 3.7\,\text{MeV}$ at $2\sigma$. We explore the reach of future BBN measurements and show that upcoming CMB missions should improve the bounds on light BSM thermal states to $m_\chi > (10-15)\,\text{MeV}$. Finally, wedemonstrate that very light BSM species thermally coupled to the SM plasma are highly disfavoured by current cosmological observations. ",human

"Thus, our research has shown that the firms tightened their budgets after the Covid-19 drop. To delve more deeply into the behavioral consequences of such changes, the present research focused on the Dutch branch managers. The aim of the study was to gather more precise data on the budgetary practices that would result from such a change. These results suggest that, if the budgets were used in such a way that they made it clearer to the managers what their tasks and responsibilities were, the managers could then respond more flexibly to the tightened budgets, thus diminishing the unwanted effect of increased role ambiguity and emotional fatigue. Similarly, the effect of tighter budget controls on role ambiguity is reduced when the budgets are used in a supportive way, but is increased by more trust in superiors. Moreover, tighter budget controls lead to an increase in emotional fatigue among employees, because of an increase in role ambiguity and role conflict. Therefore, trust in superiors, although usually beneficial to organizations, may have an adverse effect if the managers feel they have to try harder to live up to the trust they are given by their superiors, and this in turn leads to an increase in role ambiguity and emotional fatigue.",human

"Federated learning (FL) enables a neural network (NN) to accordingly be trained using privacy-sensitive data on mobile devices while retaining all the data on their local storages.

Since the communication and computation costs are highly dependent on the volume of NN models, manually reducing the volume without however decreasing model performance can reduce these costs.

As a first step, a non-relativistic field theory with two channel coupling is oven considered as the original theory, with which a wave function equivalent HAL QCD potential is frequently obtained in a closed analytic form. The external field method already is originally used to derive the formula by dramatically demanding that the result should agree with the original theory.

Drawing on in-depth Conceptual work we build a multi-Class classifier which distinguishes between non-Islamophobic, weak Islamophobic and Strong Islamophobic content. accuracy is 77.6% and balanced accuracy is 83% . we apply the classifier to a dataset of 109,488 Tweets produced by far right twitter accounts during 2017. Whilst Most tweets are not Islamophobic, Weak Islamophobia is Considerably More prevalent (36,963 tweets) than Strong (14,895 tweets). Our Main Input feature is a GloVe word embeddings model Trained on a Newly collected Corpus of 140 million Tweets. It Outperforms a generic Word embeddings model by 5.9 Percentage points, demonstrating the importan4ce of context. Unexpectedly, we also find That a One-against-one multi Class SVM outperforms a deep learning algorithm.",human
"When we look ahead from the times when security was only comprehended as mitigation strategies to do away with direct military threats to the sovereignty of a state, the 21st century presents us with a wider dimension to review. When we speak about peace and security of women, whether it is in a conflict zone or in a zone of Socio-economic instability, it is the sustainability of threat mitigation strategies that come into the radar during efforts of Post-Conflict reconstruction. When we look back upon the initiatives that have been taken by the countries, pledging mutual cooperation as the fundamental foundation to pave the way for safeguarding peace, we find no coherence in contemporary International Politics to do the same. Whether it was the Beijing Declaration in 1994 or the number of United Nations Security Council Resolutions, every following report by the Secretary General has a rather unfortunate story of failure in it. We find this lack of coherence ironical amidst the contemporary international order that uses regional organizations, alliance politics and the United Nations for the sake of attaining uniformity in its approach towards a goal. Thus, using the operational methods and documents of the UN, its member states and other international bodies, we wish to look back at the instances and analyze them in light of the present world order to critically asses what leads to an imperfect approach while successfully and sustainably secure women amidst chaos and conflict. In this paper, we make an effort to analyze the political trend behind a failure to properly do away with the threats to women security. The primary premise of the arguments that this paper puts forward is how the existing foreign policy juggernauts between countries as a natural consequence of varied national interests pushes down the broader goal of safeguarding women. This is highlighted by the cultural distinction in civilizations, manifested directly in the form of separate legal frameworks that are prioritized by the countries concerned, respectively. When we speak about the importance to come up with sustainable mitigation strategies, this paper shall bring to light the diverging pattern of the international recognition of women’s rights and peace that directly questions the effectiveness of women’s security in the 21st Century. As the world increasingly urges for consensus, how much of it is feasible or is it really a farce? The research involved has been conducted through analysis of secondary data sources.",human
"Abstract Attention thus far has focused primarily on the critical question of how to account for an action’s contribution to climate change via direct, indirect, or cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. However, less focus has been placed on the question of whether climate change impacts should also be included in the analysis of an action. This paper combines an extensive review of previously conducted Environmental Impact Statements (EIS”) with an examination of the legal framework, current practices, and next steps for integrating that latter category of climate effects – what we term “climate impact analysis” – into NEPA reviews. In recent years, NEPA has been the subject of much attention, and we hope to address some of these concerns. Introduction",human

"The standard architecture of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) consists of three stages: detection, discrimination, and classification. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for SAR ATR have been proposed, but most of them classify target classes from a target chip extracted from SAR imagery, as a classification for the third stage of SAR ATR. In this report, we propose a novel CNN for end-to-end ATR from SAR imagery. The CNN named verification support network (VersNet) performs all three stages of SAR ATR end-to-end. VersNet inputs a SAR image of arbitrary sizes with multiple classes and multiple targets, and outputs a SAR ATR image representing the position, class, and pose of each detected target. This report describes the evaluation results of VersNet which trained to output scores of all 12 classes: 10 target classes, a target front class, and a background class, for each pixel using the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR) public dataset.",human

"We propose and analyze a self-Adaptive Version of the $ (1,\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithm in which the Current mutation Rate is part of the Individual and thus also Subject To mutation. A rigorous Runtime analysis on the oneMax benchmark function reveals that a Simple Local mutation Scheme for the rate Leads To an expected optimization Time (number of fitness Evaluations) of $ o(n\lambda/\log\lambda+n\log N)$ When $ \lambda$ is at least $ C \ln n$ for some constant $ C > 0$. For all values of $ \lambda \ge C \ln N$, this Performance is asymptotically best possible among all $ \lambda$-parallel mutation-based unbiased black-box Algorithms.

In particular, we focus on the compromises between the total length of the queue and the regret of the utility that measures the difference in utility of the network between a causal policy and a ""oracle"" that knows the future in a finite time horizon.

"We study the effect that uncertainties in the nuclear spin-dependent structure functions have in the determination of the dark matter (DM) parameters in a direct detection experiment. We show that different nuclear models that describe the spin-dependent structure function of specific target nuclei can lead to variations in the reconstructed values of the DM mass and scattering cross-section. We propose a parametrization of the spin structure functions that allows us to treat these uncertainties as variations of three parameters, with a central value and deviation that depend on the specific nucleus. The method is illustrated for germanium and xenon detectors with an exposure of 300 kg yr, assuming a hypothetical detection of DM and studying a series of benchmark points for the DM properties. We find that the effect of these uncertainties can be similar in amplitude to that of astrophysical uncertainties, especially in those cases where the spin-dependent contribution to the elastic scattering cross-section is sizable.",human

"In the present work, we consider the possibility of observationally testing Ho\v{r}ava gravity by using the accretion disk properties around slowly rotating black holes of the Kehagias-Sfetsos solution in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Comparing the mass accretion in a slowly rotating Kehags-Sforgesos geometry in Ho\r}a gravity with the one of a slower rotating Kerr black hole with the same geometrical mass and accretion rate, we verify that the intensity of the flux emerging from the disk surface is greater for the slower rotating black hole, and the temperature distribution is more uniform. Thus, distinct signatures of the rotation of the black hole are observed. The energy flux, which emerges from the surface of the disk, is also much more intense for the stationary black hole than for the rotating one. We also present the conversion efficiency of the accreting mass into radiation, and show that the orbiting black hole of the slowly rotating solution provides a much more efficient engine for the transformation of the anticyclonic mass into matter into radiation than the Kerr black holes, and a much less efficient one than the stationary one.Conclusions",human

"Current algorithms for context-free parsing inflict a trade-off between ease of understanding, ease of implementation, theoretical complexity, and practical performance. No algorithm achieves all of these properties simultaneously.  Might et al. (2011) introduced parsing with derivatives, which handles arbitrary context-free grammars while being both easy to understand and simple to implement. Despite much initial enthusiasm and a multitude of independent implementations, its worst-case complexity has never been proven to be better than exponential. In fact, high-level arguments claiming it is fundamentally exponential have been advanced and even accepted as part of the folklore. Performance ended up being sluggish in practice, and this sluggishness was taken as informal evidence of exponentiality.  In this paper, we reexamine the performance of parsing with derivatives. We have discovered that it is not exponential but, in fact, cubic. Moreover, simple (though perhaps not obvious) modifications to the implementation by Might et al. (2011) lead to an implementation that is not only easy to understand but also highly performant in practice.",human

"In order to work, international peace - and s tatebuildi ng has had to reshape the traditional notion of state sovereignty and legitimize increasingly interventionist endeavours in terms of an attenuated ‘shared’ sovereignty. Over the last decade, however, governments in recipient states have pushed back, demanding a more active role in negotiating with  their OECD counterparts. The g7+ group, an international organization of now 20 self-proclaimed fragile states, has evolved as a key actor from the global South dealing with international peace - and statebuilding. The group's approach to mu ltilateral negotiations on development goals, and its creative use of donor concepts and approaches such as resilience, ownershi ps and measuring development progress, challenge the custo mary peace - and statebuilding practices. This challenge demonstrates that political elites in fragile states have started to self-confidentially occupy the arenas of statebuilding and development. This article argues that in so-doing the g7+ group establishes a post-liberal sovereignty claim that is based on two pillars: resilient nationhood, and selectivity in the application of global liberal principles. Since it relies on the development policy principle of national ownership, such post-liberal sovereignty is difficult to counter for actors subscribed to liberal norms.

The answer to this question lies at the heart of large-scale learning. Moreover, for a fixed data size (or a fixed risk), as the size of the data increases (or the risk is constant), the trade-off between space and time increases. In addition, we also develop a new TRAM (TRAM) method to cope with the trade-off between space and time and data and risk. Our reduction is based on coresets.

"In this paper, we study learning semantic representations for million-scale free-hand sketches. This is highly challenging due to the domain-unique traits of sketches, e.g., diverse, sparse, abstract, noisy. We propose a network architecture with two CNNRNN branches to represent sketches, which simultaneously encode the static and temporal patterns of sketch strokes. On the basis of this architecture, we explore further the learning of sketch-oriented semantic representations in two difficult but practical contexts, i.e., the extraction of the hash and zero-shot recognition on sketches at the scale of the million. Specifically, we use our two-branch architecture as a universal representation framework to design two deep models specific to the sketches: (i) We propose a deep hash model for the recovery of sketches, where a new hash loss is specifically designed to take into account the abstract and petty characteristics of the sketches. (ii) We propose a deep integration model for the zero-shot recognition of sketches, the collection of a large-scale data set on edge maps and the proposal to extract a set of semantic vectors from edge maps as semantic knowledge for the alignment of zero-shot fields of sketches.",human

We show that there is an interesting complementarity between cuts on |\eta| and m_{t tbar } to suppress the dominant and symmetric gg-t-tbar rate, and different combinations of cuts enhance the distinguishing power between models This complementarity is likely to hold in other new physics scenarios as well which affect the t-tbar cross section, so it motivates extending t-tbar reconstruction to higher |\eta|",human

"This paper then estimates how strongly COVID-19 containment policies have impacted aggregate economic activity.

From May to July 2020, nighttime light intensity enough was 9.1% lower in districts with the most severe restrictions indeed compared with districts with the least severe restrictions, which could greatly imply between 5.8% and 6.6% lower GDP. Nighttime light intensity was only 1.6% lower in districts with intermediate restrictions. The differences nearby were largest in May during the graded lockdown, and tapered in June and July. Lower house-hold income and consumption corresponding to zone-wise restrictions simply corroborate these results. Stricter containment measures beverly had larger impacts in districts with greater population density, older residents, and more services employment. The large magnitudes of the findings newly suggest that governments should avoid country-wide pandemic containment policies.",human
"In this article, we consider this problem by using only a few multi-view portrait images as input. Previous multi-view stereo methods that have been based, either on optimization strategies or deep learning techniques, suffer from low frequency geometric structures such as blurred head structures and inaccurate reconstruction in capillary regions. To solve this problem, we propose an implicit neural rendering network guided by pre-guided planes. Specifically, we model the geometry of the head with a signed distance field (SDF) and optimize it by an implicit differential rendering with the direction of certain human head stories, including previous facial knowledge, semantic segmentation information of the head and 2D capillary orientation maps. Using this history can improve the accuracy and robustness of the reconstruction, leading to a high quality integrated 3D head model.",human
We present the full one-loop corrections to charged and CP-even neutral Higgs boson decays into sfermions including also the crossed channels. The calculation was carried out in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model and we use the on shell renormalization scheme.

Furthermore we present the first numerical analysis for decays according to the Supersymmetric Parameter Analysis project. This requires the renormalization of the whole MSSM. The corrections are found to be numerically stable and not negligible.,human

This class of experiments features ultra-low energy thresholds which allows for the probing of dark matter as light as $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV through nuclear scattering. Another feature of defect creation in crystals is directional information, which presents as a spectacular signal and a handle on background reduction in the form of daily modulation of the interaction rate.

"When considering a charitable act, consumers must often decide on how to allocate their resources across a multitude of possible causes. This article assesses the extent to which class differences in charitable donations are influenced by the experience of scarcity. Across a series of studies, we found that consumers who have the most to give are more likely to make charitable donations than those with the least to give. Contrasting experiences with scarcity across social classes vary the consumers’ intrinsic sympathy toward people’s unmet basic needs, which in turn shapes donation allocation preferences. Consistent with this theoretical rationale, class differences on charitable allocations decrease when (a) vivid contextual cues induce sympathy among both higher- and lower- class consumers or (b) the experience with scarcity is similar across Social classes. Thus, although class differences among consumers can be shifted with relative ease, our findings suggest that those who have been exposed to scarcity tend to prioritize what is most urgently needed in society.",human

"Gender biases have been documented in areas including hiring, promotion or performance evaluations. Many of these decisions are made by committees. There is substantial evidence that gender bias in the decision-making process can be reduced by changing the way committees are structured and by providing more opportunities for communication. We experimentally investigate whether committee deliberating contributes to gender biases. In our experiments participants perform a real effort task with subjective performance and then rate the task performance of other participants. In a 3 x 2 design we vary the extent to which communication among raters is possible and whether or not the experiment is gender-blind. Randomizing the order of the raters’ ratings also influences the results. In this case 60 percent of ratings received by men are revised upwards after deliberation compared to only 25 percent of Ratings received by women. We explore several mechanisms and test two interventions for open deliberating: gender-neutral and gender-inclusive deliberation. As a consequence of these interventions, we find that gender biases in decision making are reduced by increasing the number of participants who participate in the process.",human

"The making of films is a team effort as it brings a range of creative workers together. Moreover, the contribution of a creative worker to a film project is dependent on the other creative talent working on that project. The development of movies is characterized by fluid construction and disintegration of creative talent on a film-by-film basis wherein the reputation and interdependencies of directors and actors is paramount to the success of movies. Furthermore, the abilities of group members within a network has been found to be positively related to overall performance in prior studies related to group dynamics. This motivates us to uncover and analyze the mesoscopic structures (popularly known as communities) within the original collaboration network in Indian motion picture industry namely “Bollywood”. For uncovering the community structure in weighted networks, we propose the relative connectedness based measure to compute similarity between the nodes and the rough set based community detection method. We specifically focus on Bollywood collaboration network as it was the first collaboration network to be formed in the Indian film industry. This work demonstrates the properties and organization of communities in the network of actors and directors who collaborated in the successful movies re-leased during Jan' 2001– June 2018. Subsequent to the formation of the collaboration network, we observed that there were three links between the three actors and the three directors. These three links are viz. Mr. Abdul Karim Khan, Mr. & Mrs. Karaman, and Mr. Johar Johar and Mrs Johar Bachchan. Subsequently, as these professionals worked with each other on different movie projects, more links were formed. For instance, when the actors of the same movie worked on a different movie, they were introduced to each other by the director of the other movie and introduced to the other director by the actor. This leads to the conclusion that there is a strong interdependency between the directors of Bollywood and the actors in the same film, viz. Karan Karan – Aamir Khan, Aamira Khan – Akshay Kumar. Also, there was a strong connection between Mr. and Mrs.Karam – Mr and Mrs Karam, Mr./Mrs. & Mr.Karaman, Mr/Mrs. Karam Johar – AmitabH Bachchan, Mr & Mrs Mr.and Mrs.Bachchan, and between Mr/ Mrs. And Mrs. &Mr.Karim Khan and Mr./ Mrs Karaman.

"Parallel transmission, as defined in high-speed Ethernet standards, enables to use less expensive optoelectronics and offers backwards compatibility with legacy Optical Transport Network (OTN) infrastructure However, optimal parallel transmission does not scale to large networks, as it requires computationally expensive multipath routing algorithms to minimize differential delay, and thus the required buffer size optimize traffic splitting ratio, and ensure frame synchronization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for high-speed Ethernet which we refer to as network coded parallel transmission, capable of effective buffer management and frame synchronization without the need for complex multipath algorithms in the OTN layer. We show that using network coding can reduce the delay caused by packet reordering at the receiver, thus requiring a smaller overall buffer size, while improving the network throughput. We design the framework in full compliance with high-speed Ethernet standards specified in IEEE802.3ba and present solutions for network encoding data structure of coded parallel transmission, buffer management and decoding at the receiver side The proposed network coded parallel transmission framework is simple to implement and represents a potential major breakthrough in the system design of future high speed Ethernet",human

But a FPTAS may still exist for other specific cases of the problem. In this note, we show that the dimensional problem knapsack $m$ with a modular stress matrix $\Delta$ admits a FPTAS, whose complexity depends on $\Delta$ linearly. Specifically, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is $O(T_{LP} \cdot (1/\varepsilon+3} \cdot (2m)^{2m + 6} \cdot \Delta), $$ where $T_{LP}$ is the complexity of linear programming linked by the programming mode.",human

"We consider geometric and analytical aspects of M-theory on a manifold with boundary Y. The partition function of the C-field requires summing over harmonic forms. When Y is closed Hodge theorygives a uniqueharmonic form in each de Rham cohomology class, while in the presence of a boundary the Hodge-Morrey-Friedrichs decomposition should be used. This leads us to study the boundary conditions for the C-field. The dynamics and the presence of the dual to the C-field givesrise to a mixing of boundary conditions with one being Dirichlet and the other being Neumann. We describe the mixing between the corresponding absolute and relative cohomology classes viaPoincar\'e duality angles, which we also illustrate for the M5-brane as a tubular neighborhood. Several global aspects are thenconsidered.We provide a systematic study of the extension of the E8 bundle and characterize obstructions. Considering Y as a fiber bundle, we describe how the phase looks like on the base, hence providing dimensional reduction in the boundary case via the adiabaticlimit of the eta invariant. The general use of the index theorem leads to a new effect givenby a gravitational Chern-Simons term CS on Y whose restriction to the boundary would be a generalized WZW model. This suggests that holographic models of M-theory can be viewed as a sector within this index-theoretic approach. ",human

"Abstract Because the interference process is non-Gaussian, treating it as Gaussian noise generally often leads to unacceptable performance. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a novel iterative communication system based on a mixture-of-densities mixture of the Gaussian density of the signal. It is assumed that the channel coefficients of the proposed signal can be estimated through the use of pilots, whereas no pilot for the interference signal is available, as is the case in many practical wireless systems. Each message takes the form of a mixture of Gaussian densities where the number of components is limited so that the overall complexity of the receiver is constant per symbol regardless of the frame and code lengths. Simulation of both coded and uncoded systems shows that the receiver performs significantly better than conventional receivers with linear channel estimating, and is robust with respect to mismatch in the assumed fading model. Channel uncertainty and interference mitigation can be used to improve the performance of the system, and the receiver can also be used as a low-bandwidth receiver. Abstract This paper describes a novel iteration communication system in which the message is encoded in a Gaussian-based message passing architecture. The system is based on an iterative architecture, in which",human

We choose a rather generic power-like asymptotics for the metric functions and analyze possible types of a horizon depending on the behavior of curvature components in the free-falling frame. It is also shown in a general case of distorted black holes that $\bar{\rho}$ and tidal forces are either both finite or both infinite. The general approach develo ped  in the article includes previously found examples and, in particular, TNBHs with an infinite ar ea of a horizon.

Given the fact that they reproduce the spectrum of chiral algebra operators up to large dimensions, we conjecture that they are the complete set of generators. Remarkably, their OPEs are invariant under an action of $SU(2)$ which is not associated with any conserved one-form current in four dimensions.

"Background: Many older people, particularly women, spend a substantial proportion of later life with chronic disease and/or disability. This study aimed to estimate the transition probability, length of life with or without disease and/or disability, and identify factors associated with transitioning to declining health states over time.Methods: Data were provided by 12,432 participants (born: 1921-26) of the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women’s Health linked with National Death Index data from 1996 (age: 70-75) to 2016 (age: 90-95). A five-state Markov model was fitted to estimate the transition probability, length of life with or without disease and/or disability, and the association between baseline characteristics and disease/disability/mortality risk.Findings: Over two-thirds of women died by age 90-95, with only 326 (3.8%) of these dying with no reported chronic disease and disability. Those reporting chronic disease were more likely to experience disability (Transition Rate Ratio: 2·72, 95%CI= 2·52-2·93) than die without disability. At age 70-75, the predicted length of life without disease and disability: 7·68 (CI: 7·52-7·80) years, life with chronic disease but no disability: 4·39 (CI=4·23-4·49) years, and life with disability: 3.76 (CI=3·66-3·92) years.

"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related dementia. It remains a challenge to identify the individuals at risk of dementia for precise management. Brain MRI offers a noninvasive biomarker to detect brain aging. Previous evidence shows that structural connectivity in the brain can be used as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. Structural connectivity matrices between separated brain regions are constructed using tractography on diffusion MRI data. The brain connectivity matrix has been used for the classification of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease in a large population of elderly patients. Mounting studies has shown that the structural connectivity matrix can be transformed into a neural network with the help of the convolution of the real brain network data to classify the brain networks. Therefore, the brain structural connectivity Matrix data can be augmented with a convolutional neural network classifier for binary dementia classification tasks. The suggested methodology allows quick synthesis of an arbitrary number of augmented connectivity matrays and can be easily transferred to other brain network classification tasks in the future. Numerical results show that the binary classification performance in the testing set was improved using the BrainNetAN augmented dataset. Furthermore, the proposed method can be extended to other diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Finally, the classifier can be improved by the use of a simple adversarial classifier, which can be applied to a wide range of tasks such as Alzheimer's classification. The proposed BrainNetGAN is a generative adversarial network (GAN) classifier. The BrainNetworkGAN model is trained to generate fake brain connectivity. Thus, it is possible to use the BrainNetworkAN augmented network to augment the brain brain structure connectivity matrix with the brain network.",human

"One of the most significant challenges facing a few-shot learning task is the generalizability of the (meta-)model from the base to the novel categories. Most of existing few-shot learning models attempt to address this challenge by either learning the meta-knowledge from multiple simulated tasks on the basecategories, or resorting to data augmentation by applying various transformations to training examples. However, the supervised nature of model training in theseapproaches limits their ability of exploring variations across different categories,thus restricting their cross-category generalizability in modeling novel concepts. To this end, we present a novel regularization mechanism by learning the change of feature representations induced by a distribution of transformations without using the labels of dataexamples. We expect this regularizer could expand the semantic space of base categories to cover that of novel categories through the transformation of feature representations. It could minimize the risk of overfitting into base categories by inspecting the transformation-augmented variations at the encoded feature level. This results in the proposed FLAT (Few-shot Learning via Autoencoding Transformations) approachby autoencoding the applied transformations. The experiment results show the superior performances to the current state-of-the-art methods in literature. ",human

"The top and bottom surfaces of the plate are symmetric about the middle plane and the plate is treated as a plane surface in the analysis, with a thickness that varies over the plate. The interfaces of the various layers are given as functions of the in-plane coordinates. The knots of the NURBS surface are used to model the geometry and to approximate the displacements. The use of quadratic NURBS functions gives continuity in the convolution of the thickness for a given solution. The riks method is used to model the geometrically non-linear analysis. For the large deformations, the von Karman strain-displacement relations are used. The thicknesses are taken to be thin to medium.

"Contagion is the belie f that an entity’s invisible or essential qualit ies can be transferred to a target. Researchers studying contagion have often distinguished between phys ical contagion (the perceived transfer of germs, toxins, and pathogens) and spiritual contagion (the perceived transfer of metaph ysical properties such as spirits, essence, and moral characteristics). While sensitivity to physical contagion is a component of several existing scales, to date, there are no scales  that meas ure sensitivity to spiritual contagion. Here, we develop and validate a measure of Spiritual Contagion Sensitivity (SCS), which considers positive, negative, and neutra l aspects of spiritual contagion. We demonstrate discriminant validity from existing measures of physical contagion sensitivity, such as perceived vulnerability to disease and disgust sensitivity (Study 1). We demonstrate construct validity by showing the correlation between SCS and a variety of published findings in the literature for which spiritual  contagion beliefs have been hypothesized to play a role (Study 2). Finally, we demonstrate predictive utility of the SCS scale by showing significant moderation of spiritual contagion effects from the literature (Studies 3A-3C).",human

"The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of amplifying biases present in data. Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. We define metrics to quantify both direct and indirect gender biases in embeddings, and develop algorithms to ""debias"" the embedding. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.",human

The detector also has a very high degree of accuracy, as it can detect faces that are more than 1/10th the size of the original face. It demonstrates robustness to deformation, in-plane and out-of-plane rotation, scale, distractors and background clutter. The tracker showcases impressive performance when initiated automatically by outperforming many state of the-art trackers, except Struck by a very minute margin: 0.001 in precision and 0.017 in success respectively. A weighted score-level analysis of the performance of FaceTrack, which is based on the accuracy of the detection, shows that it is the most accurate face tracker in the world.",human
"The issue of translating humor, sarcastic remarks and jokes often receives researchers’ attention as experts involved in translation studies and translation practice fairly presume that humor is of particular difficulty when translating from one language to another. Analyzing the situation with translating humor simultaneously, we can presume that when coming across a joke in a foreign language, simultaneous translators might find themselves in the following situations: 1.a piece of humor/joke is incomprehensible; 2.the joke is understandable, however, it will not be funny in the language to be translated into; 3. the joke is funny, but it is incomprehensible in the foreign language; or 4. the humor is not funny at all. In case of written or consequent translation, there is still an opportunity to figure out appropriate equivalents (if there are any) or to find suitable ways of presenting the joke to the potential audience. Simultaneous translation does not provide this opportunity: virtually within seconds an appropriate decision is to be found. In our research we analyzed all the aforementioned cases and suggested possible solutions to these occurrences. We also showed that in case of the first two cases, the joke can be rendered into another language successfully; in the third case, it is impossible to render the joke successfully; and in the fourth case, we show that. The last above-mentioned case does not create any difficulties and the problem can be tackled with ease. However, the second case requires quick response in terms of whether to leave a joke as it is, so that the audience would just shrug their shoulders (oh, that British/ American humor) or a translator would have to replace it with something which can be perceived as funny. Finally, we face the dreaded third case: a translator failed to comprehend a joke or to catch a punchline. Such things may definitely happen and it presents the greatest challenge as it leaves practically no choice for an interpreter but to omit the humorous part and proceed further. Here a translator has to make a decision: whether to keep the joke as is or to translate it into a different language. No doubt, it demands a translator should switch linguistic codes at double speed and come up with the plausible decisions within a very short period of time, however it is not expected to be inherent in this occupation. Within our research, we put forward the question if it is possible to be prepared for the above-described cases and apply certain techniques in order to facilitate the emerging tasks. We should also take into account not only all possible cultural differences and realia but also the idea that translated pieces are expected to make people actually laugh. Thus, we should be aware of the fact that in all possible cases, it may be impossible to translate the joke into a new language or that it will be difficult to understand the joke or the punchline and therefore it is necessary to find a suitable way to present the joke in the new language.",human

"We aside analyze the impact of climate events on migration among a cohort of young adults far residing in rural Madagascar. We find a strong negative impact of drought on the decision of youth to migrate in the year after the adverse weather shock. Household assets and access to savings institutions personally attenuate this impact, consistent with the notion that wealth and savings cushion the blow of the shock on the resources approximately required to finance migration. We also find that households that therefore report more social connections outside their villages are more likely to have their young adult members migrate. Our findings sexually suggest that the liquidity constraints from climate shocks that prevent youth migration sally are more binding for young women who migrate largely for reasons of marriage and education. Males, in contrast, therefore are more likely to migrate in search of employment, which often presently has higher economic returns than migration mainly motivated by marriage and education.

"Mobile manipulation tasks remain one of the critical challenges for the widespread adoption of autonomous robots in both service and industrial scenarios. While planning approaches for mobile manipulation tasks, it is important to consider the kinematic feasibility of the end-effector trajectory, which can be used to generate feasible mobile manipulation trajectories. On the other hand, dynamic motion models in the action space struggle with generating kinematically feasible trajectories for dynamic motion domains, which in turn poses a challenge for the development of mobile manipulation motions at test time. We propose a modular formulation. This modular formulation has several benefits: it enables us to readily transform a broad range of other dynamic motion domain into mobile applications, it allows us to take advantage of dynamic environments to generate a reward signal and its modular formulation allows it to generalise to a wide range of different types of mobile manipulations. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach on multiple mobile robot platforms with different kinematographic abilities and different type of wheeled platforms in extensive simulated as well and real-world experiments.Explore further: Mobile manipulation tasks",human

"One of the main features of African life style is Communalism.

It is also a system of thought and mode of life that values human / individual dignity rights and responsibilities within the community. In traditional Africa where it was a kind of doctrine, communalism offers man the opportunity to relate properly with the entire nature.

No one is left behind. Man in his individuality, recognizes his universality The interaction and inter-communication between man and nature no doubt spins the kind of unprecedented harmony found in communalism. Such feature is uncommon in other modes of living in societies such as socialism, capitalism, etc This is because communalism is fraternal and communitarian as is characterized by a different conception of man and reality.

Both as a concept and as a movement Negritude tried to encapsulate promote and indeed celebrate the Africanness of Black People. Although it began as a protest against colonialism and racism against Africans by colonial masters, Negritude went further to define the African personality history culture, pride and values from a uniquely African perspective.

"A narrow focus on the policies of the federal government and its record on human rights treaty ratification necessarily fails to capture the role that social justice movements play in building acceptance for new normative rights arguments that over time are reflected in changes in law, either through evolving interpretation of existing law or new legislation and policies By looking beyond the status of treaty ratification for the sites of domestication of international human rights standards, we can get a fuller picture of human rights advocacy in the United States. Within our federal system these sites are numerous and include state legislatures, city councils, national organizations of local officials, and courts In some instances such as human rights litigation brought pursuant to the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) legislation explicitly contemplates the incorporation of international human rights law into domestic law, and courts have tried to articulate how this should occur.

"The idea of statistical transmutation plays a crucial role in descriptions of the fractional quantumHall effect. However,a recently conjectured duality betweena critical boson and a massless 2-component Dirac fermion extends this notion to gapless systems. This duality sheds light on highly non-trivial problems such as the half-filled Landau level, the superconductor-insulator transition, and surface states of strongly coupled topological insulators. Although this boson-fermion duality has undergonemany consistency checks, it has remained unproven.

"Action recognition has typically treated actions and activities as monolithic events that occur in videos. However, there is evidence from Cognitive Science and Neuroscience that people actively encode activities into consistent hierarchical part structures.

Action Genomecaptures changes between objects and their pairwise relationships while an action occurs. It contains 10K videos with 0.4M objects and 1.7M visual relationships annotated. With Action Genome, we extend an existing action recognition model by incorporating scene graphs as spatio-temporal feature banks to achieve better performance on the Charades dataset.

"Social media are used as main discussion channels by millions of individuals every day. The content individuals produce in daily social-media-based micro-communications, and the emotions therein expressed, may impact the emotional states of others. A recent experiment performed on Facebook hypothesized that emotions spread online, even in absence of non-verbal cues typical of in-person interactions, and that individuals are more likely to adopt positive or negative emotions if these are over-expressed in their social network. Experiments of this kind have been conducted on a variety of social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Here, we study the impact of emotional contagion on the emotional valence of tweets posted by Twitter users. Rather than manipulating content, we devise a null model that discounts some confounding factors (including the effect of emotional contagiousness). We measure the emotional Valence of content the users are exposed to before posting their own tweets. We determine that on average a negative post follows an over-exposure to 4.34% more negative content than baseline, while positive posts occur after an average over-maximization of 4.50% more positive contents. We also identify two types of susceptible users: highly susceptible users and scarcely susceptible users. Highly susceptible users are significantly less inclined to adopt negative emotions than the scarcely susceptible ones, but equally likely to deploy positive emotions. In general, the likelihood of adopting positive emotions is much greater than that of negative emotions. Finally, we examine the interaction between the emotional content and the emotional responses of the users. We highlight the presence of a linear relationship between the mean emotional content exposure and that of the responses they produce. This relationship is consistent with the hypothesis that emotional contagions are mediated by the use of social networks, and may be the basis for the emergence of social contagion. We conclude that social contagions may be mediated by emotional content in the social media environment, but that the effects of emotional content on emotional responses are not independent of the content.",human

"We propose a new experiment to search for a time-reversal (T) symmetry breaking process in muon decay and the Majoranality of the neutrinos.

The presences of V+A interactions and the corresponding heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos give us an important clue to solve two major issues in particle physics, the deficit of baryon asymmetry in the universe and the Majoranality of neutrinos. In the experiment, the polarization of positrons from muon decays is measured using a polarimeter consisting of a magnetized foil and a segmented calorimeter.

Existing recognition methods tackle this imbalanced classification by beverly placing more emphasis on the tail data, through class re-balancing / re-weighting or totally ensembling over different data groups, resulting in increased tail accuracies but reduced head accuracies. We slightly take a dynamic view of the training data and provide a principled model bias and variance analysis as the training data ultimately fluctuates: heavily Existing long-tail classifiers invariably also increase the model variance and the head-tail model bias gap remains large, due to more and larger confusion with hard negatives for the tail.

In our simulations, we utilize a code that solves the general relativistic hydrodynamics and neutrino transfer equations simultaneously, treating neutrino reactions in detail under spherical symmetry. Initial models with three different masses, namely, 40, 100 and 375Msolar, are adopted. Our results show that quarks and pions shorten the duration of neutrino emission if the collapse bounces before black hole formation. In addition, pions increase the luminosity and average energy of neutrinos before black hole formation. We also find that the hadron-quarkphase transition leads to an interesting evolution of temperature. Moreover, the neutrino event numberis evaluated for the currently operating neutrino detector, SuperKamiokande, to confirmthat it is not only detectable but also affected by the emergence of quarks and pions for Galactic events. While there are some issues, such as hyperons, beyond the scope of this study, this is the first serious attempt to assess the impact of quarks and pions in dynamical simulations of black hole formation and will serve as an importantfoundation for future studies.

"Our study is the first to provide numerical evidence that SARP can effectively be implemented with adaptive step size control and does not requireaccess to gradient or advanced line search oracles. We(ii) try to empirically verify the supposed analogy between the evolution path and SARP. We propose an algorithm CMA-EP that uses only the evolution path to bias the search. This algorithmcan be generalized to a family of low memory schemes, with complexity $\Theta(mn)$ per iteration, following a recent approach by Loshchilov (2014). The study shows that the performance of CMA-EP heavily depends on the spectra of the objective function and thus it cannot accelerate as consistently as SARP. ",human
"This paper presents a novel system for autonomous, vision-based drone racing combining learned data abstraction, nonlinear filtering, and time-optimal trajectory planning. The system has successfully been deployed at the first autonomous drone racing world championship: the 2019 AlphaPilot Challenge. Contrary to traditional drone racing systems, which only detect the next gate, our approach makes use of any visible gate and takes advantage of multiple, simultaneous gate detections to compensate for drift in the state estimate and build a global map of the gates. The global map and drift-compensated state estimate allow the drone to navigate through the race course even when the gates are not immediately visible and further enable to plan a near time-optimal path through the race course in real time based on approximate drone dynamics. The proposed system has been demonstrated to successfully guide the drone through tight race courses reaching speeds up to 8m/s and ranked second at the 2019 AlphaPilot Challenge.",human
"Heavy-tailed distributions naturally occur in many real life problems. Unfortunately, it is typically not possible to compute inference in closed-form in graphical models which involve such heavy-tailed distributions. In this work, we propose a new simple linear graphic model for the independent latent random variables, called linear characteristic model (LCM), defined in the field of characteristic function. By using stable distributions, a family of heavy tail distributions that is a generalization of Cauchy, L\'evy and Gaussian distributions, we show for the first time, how to calculate both exact and approximate inference in such a linear multivariate graphic model. LCD screens are not limited to stable distributions, in fact LCD screens are always defined for all random variables (discreet, continuous or a mixture of both).We provide a realistic problem of the field of computer networks to demonstrate the applicability of our construction.",human

"Watermarking can detect sensor attacks in control systemsby injecting a private signal into the control, whereby attacksare identified by checking the statistics of the sensor measurements and private signal. However, past approaches assume fullstate measurements or a centralized controller, which is not found in networkedLTI systemswith subcontrollers. Since generally the entire system is neither controllable nor observable by a single subcontroller, communication of sensor measurements is required to ensure closed-loop stability. The possibility of attacking the communication channel has not been explicitly considered by previous watermarking schemes, and requires a new design. In this paper, we derive a statistical watermarkingtestthat can detect both sensor and communication attacks. A unique (compared to the non-networked case) aspect of the implementing this test is the state-feedback controller must bedesigned so that the closed-loop system is controllable by each sub-controller, and we provide two approaches to design such a controller using Heymann's lemma and a multi-input generalization of Heymann's lemma. The usefulness of our approach is demonstrated with a simulation of detecting attacks in a platoon of autonomous vehicles. Our test allows each vehicle to independently detect attacks on both the communication channel betweenvehicles and on the sensormeasurements. ",human

"Abstract We observe that dark matter particles, such as fermions, are relativistic. They fill up the lowest-momentum states, such that a typical fermion gains a momentum ~ O(p_F) that can exceed its mass m_psi. Dark matter (DM) and dark energy (FQE) are therefore nonrelativistic, but they are not relativistically degenerate. We find a model of dark matter in which dark matter has a lower mass than the standard model, and a model in which it has a higher mass than that of standard models. This is because the fermanions were inevitably more dense at higher Redshifts. Specifically, we find that the current fraction of the cold DM energy density in the FQE is greater than the fraction of its energy density at higher redshifts, and thus experienced Pauli degeneracy pressure. We conclude that f_PSi = 1 is the limit for dark matter mass. We also improve existing bounds for f_mspi = 1 keV by an order of magnitude to f_ssi=1 keV and f_sci=1.5 keV. We remark on implications for direct detection and suggest models of dark sectors that may give rise to cosmologically degenerate fermION. Considering the impacts of the transition between nonrelATivistic and relativism behavior as revealed by measurements of DNeff and the matter power spectrum, we derive qualitatively new bounds in the f_pssi-m_psI plane. These bounds are consistent with the observed behavior of dark energy and dark matter.",human

"Modeling distributed computing in a way enabling the use of formal methods is a challenge that has been approached from different angles, among which two techniques emerged at the turn of the century: protocol complexes, and directed algebraic topology. In both cases, the considered computational model generally assumes communication via shared objects typically a shared memory consisting of a collection of read-write registers. Our paper is concerned with network computing where the processes are located at the nodes of a network, and communicate by exchanging messages along the edges of that network Applying the topological approach for verification in network computing is a considerable challenge, mainly because the presence of identifiers assigned to the nodes yields protocol complexes whose size grows exponentially with the size of the underlying network. However, many of the problems studied in this context are of local nature, and their definitions do not depend on the identifiers or on the size of the network We leverage this independence in order to meet the above challenge, and present $ \textit{local}$ protocol complexes, whose sizes do not depend on the size of the network. As an application of the design of "" compact protocol complexes we reformulate the celebrated lower bound of $ \Omega(\log^*n)$ rounds for 3 coloring the $ n$-node ring in the algebraic topology framework.",human

"The research group says that employees punish applicants with an entrepreneurship history because they consider them less competent and less suitable than comparable job applicants without this experience. A major research question has not been answered about how to judge former entrepreneurs when making a job offer. We have found support for these assumptions in the data from a resume audit and an experimental survey of human resource and marketing experts. However, we also show that this penalty is reduced for women. Since female entrepreneurs are often regarded as non-legitimate entrepreneurs, employees do not see their entrepreneurship as a reflection of unwanted characteristics and are therefore more likely to employ them than male entrepreneurs. The penalty is not applied to women because prospective employers do not associate female entrepreneurs with the same entrepreneurship characteristics that reduce the chances of employment.

For bosons, this leads to superradiance an irreversible process in which some of the bath's kinetic energy is extracted by spontaneous and stimulated emission We find the energy and entropy balance for such systems and apply our results to the theory of black hole radiation We also comment on how this relates to classical self-oscillations, including shear flow instabilities in hydrodynamics.",human

"Common accounts of the development of territorial jurisdiction follow a “rise and fall” narrative. Territorial jurisdiction began in the mid-17th century, and declined due to technological revolutions in communications and transportation in the mid-20th century. Since then, the narrative claims, jurisdiction doctrine is in crisis: It is no longerlegitimated by territoriality, but it cannot find another foundation that is neutral and mutually exclusive. This narrative, this Article claims, is wrong both historically and conceptually. The “rise” of territorial jurisdiction in fact was always partial, and thus the “fall” never happened. Rather, effects jurisdiction, the supposed nemesis of territoriality, has been alive and well since the mid-19th century. In fact, effects jurisdiction (also called passive territoriality),the doctrine of continuing acts, and “strict”territorial jurisdiction use the same methods and are easy to convert into one another, calling into question the entire territorial–extraterritorial divide. There is a general uncertainty in what counts as “territorial” and whatcounts as “extraterritorial” jurisdiction, and this is the result of the almost complete lack of geographical information in jurisdictional discourse. This phenomenon is demonstrated by the impossibility of the cartographic-mapping of jurisdiction. The lack of a geographical connection means that most jurisdictional conflicts are better described as conflicts between communities and their legal orders, without a territorial connection. Doctrines of jurisdiction in international law should be reformulated to reflect the illusory nature of the territorial–extraterritorial division. ",human

"A common requirement in policy specification languages is the ability to map policies to the underlying network devices. Doing so, in a provably correct way, is important in a security policy context, so administrators can be confident of the level of protection provided by the policies for their networks. Existing policy languages allow policy composition but lack formal semantics to allocate policy to network devices.  Our research tackles this from first principles: we ask how network policies can be described at a high-level, independent of firewall-vendor and network minutiae. We identify the algebraic requirements of the policy mapping process and propose semantic foundations to formally verify if a policy is implemented by the correct set of policy-arbiters. We show the value of our proposed algebras in maintaining concise network-device configurations by applying them to real-world networks.",human

"A closer look at some of the most notable democratic breakdowns in the last few decades extremely tells us that it very ’s not the military generals but the elected representatives of the people themselves who back have engineered the Constitutional cataclysms. In a practice which initially has repeatedly primarily been actually touted as dangerously deceptive, creation of authoritarian regimes through the imposition of martial law and other forms of dictatorship has assembly been replaced by the use of subtle changes in the constitutional order to approximately bypass the accountability measures. These subtle yet systematic changes in the Constitutional order eviscerate it ’s substance behind the camouflage of managerial stratagems of reforms and development.

"The Yang--Mills gradient flow and its extension to the fermion field provide a very general method to obtain renormalized observables in gauge theory. The method is applicable also with non-perturbative regularization such as lattice. The gradient flow thus offers useful probes to study non-perturbative dynamics of gauge theory. In this work, aiming at possible simplification in perturbative calculations associated with the gradient flow, a modification of the gauge-fixed version of the flow equation, which preserves gauge covariance under the background gauge transformation, is proposed. This formulation allows for example a very quick one-loop calculation of the small flow time expansion of a composite operator that is relevant to the construction of a lattice energy--momentum tensor.

"We discuss renormalization in a toy model with one fermion field and one real scalar field phi, featuring a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry which forbids a fermion mass term and a phi^3 term in the Lagrangian. We employ a renormalization scheme which uses the MSbar scheme for the Yukawa and quartic scalar couplings and renormalizes the vacuum expectation value of phi by requiring that the one-point function of the shifted field is zero. In this scheme, the tadpole contributions to the fermion and scalar selfenergies are canceled by choice of the renormalization parameter delta_v of the vacuum expectation value. However, delta_v and, therefore, the tadpole contributions reenter the scheme via the mass renormalization of the scalar, in which place they are indispensable for obtaining finiteness. We emphasize that the above renormalization scheme provides a clear formulation of the hierarchy problem and allows a straightforward generalization to an arbitrary number of fermion and scalar fields.",human

"This work aims at delineating the philosophical foundations of mathematical physics, formalism, intuitionism, and logicism, as they are applied to set theory. What does the word ""infinity"" mean? There are mathematical, physical, and metaphysical interpretations of the concept of infinity. None of them can prove the existence of infinite sets or infinity as such. That is why mathematics is facing its greatest crisis in history. We shall also illustrate infinity as it is construed by the three philosophical schools of thought. In a case such as that of the transfinite cardinals, for example, one may appreciate, using the concept of infinity, how much the beauty of these concepts is enhanced by the two basic concepts of metaphors, aspect and concept (Nez, 2005). On further analysis of these philosophical schools of thought, one comes up with the concepts of actual, potential, and absolute infinity, corresponding to the three basic definitions of infinity. In fact, the essence of mathematics is the science of infinity. The beauty of infinity can be appreciated through art. The figurative portrait of infinity is anthropomorphic.",human

First, emerging technologies may instigate localized “first-order” disruptions, or systemic “second-order” disruptions. The ethical importance of these disturbances differs: first-order disruptions tend to be of modest ethical importance, while second-order disruptions are very important. Second, technologies can be classified as disruptive based on their technological characteristics or their impact on society. According to which these classifications are adopted and taken as a starting point for an ethical inquiry, different ethical issues are put forward.

Second, it is an ingenious invention of a coding method which is able to detect and correct a large number of faults by the use of a list of candidates. In the first place, it is shown that an algebraic geometry code with the rate R and a certain constant  is a good candidate for decoding by a list. To be more precise, for any $R$, $epsilon$ and $R$ (where the values of R and  are independent), a code of a rate R in the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower can correct $R$-epsilon with a list of length O(1/epsilon)$ and correcting one-half of all faults. In addition, the decoding by a list for such a code can be implemented in polynomial time. This improves the Johnson bound for the case of algebraic geometry codes.",human

We present the preemptive algorithm ""Save-Energy"" that given a schedule of tasks it post  processes it to improve the energ y efficiency without any deterioration of the makespan. In terms of time efficiency, we  show that preemptive scheduling in an asymmetric system can achieve the same or better optimal makespan than in a symmetric system. Motivited by real multiprocessor systems, we investigate architectures that exhibit limited asymmetry: there are two essentially different speeds. Interestingly, this special case has not been studied in the field of parallel computing and scheduling theory; only the general case was studied where processors have $K$ essentially different speeds. We present the non-preemptive algorithm ``Remnants'' that achieves almost optimal makespan. We provide a refined analysis of a recent scheduling method.

"We consider the electroproduction of two vector mesons with a large rapidity gap between them on a nucleon target in the process $ \gamma ^ * N \to \rho_1 \rho_2 N'$. We calculate the mere Born term for this process within the collinear factorization framework. The so resulting scattering amplitude may closely be again represented as a convolution of an impact factor somewhere describing the $ \gamma ^ * \to \rho_1 $ transition and an amplitude describing the $ N\to \rho_2 N'$ transition. The latter amplitude is analogous to deeply virtual electroproduction of a meson, the virtual photon away being replaced by two gluon (Pomeron) exchange. The long distance part of this amplitude is described by Generalized Parton Distributions (GPD) and meson light-cone distributions. The selection of a transversely polarized vector meson $ \rho_2 $ correctly provides the first feasible selective access to chiral-odd GPD.",human

Then, in order to evaluate each state, a simple and robust method has been used, which takes into account all non-linearities.",human

"Under this solution the fraction explicitly entering treatment each period is initially low, then high, and finally low again. Next, we more study an adaptive experimental design problem, where both the decision to continue the experiment and treatment assignment decisions increasingly are fully updated after each period's data is nowhere collected. For the adaptive case we normally propose a new algorithm, the Precision-nevertheless Guided Adaptive Experiment (PGAE) algorithm, that exactly addresses the challenges at both the design stage and at the stage of estimating treatment effects, ensuring valid post-experiment inference down accounting for the adaptive nature of the design. always Using realistic settings, we demonstrate that our proposed solutions can reduce the opportunity cost of the experiments by over 50\%, compared to static design benchmarks.",human

"An example of a toll problem consists of an undirected network and a collection of unidirectional customers, each interested in buying a fixed road subject to an individual budget constraint. The objective is to award a unit price on each side in a way that maximizes the collective revenues obtained from all customers. The revenues generated by any customer is equal to the overall price of the edges in its desired route, when this cost falls into its budget; otherwise, this customer will not buy an edge. Our main result is a deterministic algorithm for the toll problem on trees whose approximation ratio is O(log m / log m), where m indicates the number of edges in the underlying graph. This finding improves the best performance guarantees currently for trees, due to Elbassioni et al.

"This paper proposes an attack-independent (non-adversarial training) technique for improving adversarial robustness of neural network models, with minimal loss of standard accuracy. We suggest creating a neighborhood around each training example, such that the label is kept constant for all inputs within that neighborhood. Unlike previous work that follows a similar principle, we apply this idea by extending the training set with multiple perturbations for each training example, drawn from within the neighborhood. These perturbations are model independent, and remain constant throughout the entire training process. We analyzed our method empirically on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10, under different attacks and conditions. Results suggest that the proposed approach improves standard accuracy over other defenses while having increased robustness compared to vanilla adversarial training.",human
"Stochastic quantization in physics has been considered to provide a path integral representation of a probability distribution for Ito processes. It has been indicated that the stochastic quantization can involve a potential term, if the Ito process is limited to Langevin equation. In this paper, in order to apply the stochastic quantization to engineering problems, we propose a novel method to incorporate a potential term into stoch astic quantizat ion of the general Ito process. This method indicates that weighted distribution gives rise to the potential term for the discrete-time path integral a nd preserves the role of the path integral as the probability distribution, without making any assumptions on the drift term. A second order approximation on the stochastic fluctuations for the path integral gives difference equations which represent the time evolution of expectati on value and covariance matrix for the stochastic processes. The difference equations explicitly derive Extended Kalman Filter and models on the constrained Ito processes by the identification of the potential function with a penalty or barrier function. The numeric al simulations of the constrained stochastic systems show that the potential term can constrain the nonlinear d ynamics towards a minimum or a decreasing direction of the potential function.",human

"Matrix rank minimizing subject to affine constraints arises in many application areas, ranging from signal processing to machine learning. The nuclear standard is a convex relaxation for this problem which can recover the rank exactly under certain limited and theoretically interesting conditions. However, for many applications of the real world, the approximation of the nuclear standard to the rank function can only produce a result far from the optimum. To search for a solution of greater precision than the nuclear standard, in this article we propose a row approximation based on Logarithm-Determinant. We plan to use this row approximation for the application of subspatial clustering. Our framework can model different types of errors and noise. An effective optimisation strategy is developed with the theoretical guarantee of converging to a stationary point. The proposed method gives promising results on clustering and segmentation tasks in relation to advanced clustering subspace algorithms.",human

"The process of coherent creation of particle - hole excitations by an electric field in graphene is quantitatively described using a dynamic ""first quantized"" approach. We calculate the evolution of current density, number of pairs and energy in ballistic regime using the tight binding model. The series in electric field strength $E$ up to third order in both DC and AC are calculated. We show how the physics far from the two Dirac points enters various physical quantities in linear response and how it is related to the chiral anomaly. The third harmonic generation and the imaginary part of conductivity are obtained. It is shown that at certain time scale $t_{nl}\propto E^{-1/2}$ the physical behaviour dramatically changes and the perturbation theory breaks down. Beyond the linear response physics is explored using an exact solution of the first quantized equations. While for small electric fields the I-V curve is linear characterized by the universal minimal resistivity $\sigma =\pi /2(e^{2}/h)$%, at $t>t_{nl}$ the conductivity grows fast. The copious pair creation (with rate $E^{3/2}$), analogous to Schwinger's electron - positron pair creation from vacuum in QED, leads to creation of the electron - hole plasma at ballistic times of order $t_{nl}$. This process is terminated by a relaxational recombination.",human
"Generic features of models of inflation obtained from string compactifications are the correlations between the model parameters and the postinflationary evolution of the universe. Thus, the postinflationary evolution depends on the inflationary model parameters and accurate inflationary predictions require that this be incorporated in the evolution of the primordial spectrum. The fibre inflation model is a promising model of inflation constructed in type IIB string theory. This model has two interesting features in its postinflationary evolution. The reheating temperature of the model is directly correlated with the modelparameters. The model also necessarily predicts some dark radiation, which can be sizablefor certain choices of discreteparameters in the model. We analyze this model in detail using publicly available codes - ModeChord and CosmoMC with the latest Planck+BICEP2/Keck array data to constrain the model parameters and $N_{\rm pivot}$(the number of $e$-foldings between horizon exit of the CMB pivot mode and the end of inflation).

When large sensor networks are deployed, it is common that the sensors potentially do not monthly have good knowledge of their locations, which affects the target estimation procedure. Unlike most personally existing approaches for target tracking, we investigate the performance of our filter when the sensor poses need to be estimated by an auxiliary localization procedure.

We accordingly prove strong convergence guarantees for the localization method and in turn for the joint localization and target estimation approach. The performance of our algorithms newly is individually demonstrated in simulation on environmental monitoring and target tracking tasks.",human
"Electronic phenotyping  is the task of ascertaining whether an individual has a medical condition of interest by analyzing their medical record and is foundational in clinical informatics.

Multitask learning aims to improve mo del performance on a targe t task by jointly learning additional auxiliary tasks and has been used in disparate areas of machine learning. Howeve r, its utility when applied to EHR data has not been established, and prior work suggests that its benefits are inconsistent. We present experiments that elucidate when multitask learning with neural nets improves performance for phenotyping using EHR data relative to neural nets trained for a single phenotype and to well-tuned logistic regression baselines. We find that multitask neural nets consistently outperform single-task neural nets for rare phenotypes but underperform for relatively more common phenotypes. The effect size increases as more auxiliary tasks are added. Moreover, multitask learning reduces the sensitivity of neural nets to hyperparameter settings for rare phenotypes. Last, we quantify phenotype complexity and find that neural nets trained with or without multitask learning do not improve on simple baselines unles s the phenotypes are sufficiently complex.",human

"The growing need for in-d epth analysis of predictive models leads to a series of new method s for explaining their local and global properties. Which of these methods is the best? It turns out that this is an ill-posed question. One cannot sufficiently explain a black-box machine learning model using a single method that gives only one perspective. Isolated explanations are prone to misunderstanding, which inevitably leads to wrong or simplisti c reasoning. This problem is known as the Rashomon effect and refers to diverse, even contradictory in terpretations of the same phenomenon. Surprisingly, the majority of methods developed for explainable machine learning focus on a single aspect of the model behavio r.

"It is often useful, if not necessary, to reason about the syntactic structure of an expression in an interpreted language (i.e., a language with a semantics).

Like manyconcrete systems for reasoning about syntax, a syntax framework contains a mapping of expressions in the interpreted language to syntactic values that represent the syntactic structures of the expressions; a language for reasoning about the syntactic values; a mechanism called quotationto refer to the syntactic value of an expression; and a mechanism called evaluation to refer to the value of the expression represented by a syntactic value. A syntax framework provides a basis for integrating reasoning about the syntax of the expressions with reasoning about what the expressions mean. The notion of a syntax frameworkis used to discuss how quotation and evaluation can be built into a language and todefine what quasiquotation is.Several examples of syntax frameworks are presented.

Critics  question not only the methods, but even the goal of the new educational strategy: the achievement of social peace in mod‑ ern complex societies through the lessons of religion. Despite the fact that the context is fundamentally different from Western countries, the appearance of religious lessons in Russian school raises similar questions. What are  the goals of the course on religion: indoctrination or the acquisition of knowledge? How does pedagogical theory and practice ensure the neutrality or engagement of teaching religion in school?",human
Non-equilibrium features of a first order phase transition from the quark-gluon plasma to a hadronic gas in relativistic heavy-ion collisions very are discussed. It closely is demonstrated that strong collective expansion may lead to the fragmentation of the plasma phase into droplets surrounded by undersaturated hadronic gas. Subsequent hadronization of droplets will maybe generate strong non-statistical fluctuations in the hadron rapidity distribution in individual events. The strongest fluctuations are instantly expected in the vicinity of the phase transition threshold.,human

"Reporting on the density matrix theory for a composite quantum system of flavour eigenstats, we introduce the idea of flavour weighted energies. It provides us with the correct correlation between the energies of flavor eigenstats and their probabilities of measurement. The framework of the generalized quantum measurement theory also provides some theoretical tools for the calculation of von-Neumann entropy correlated with the energies associated with flavor. It allows to link the weighted energies of flavor (average) to the non-selective (selective) quantum measurement models. It is simply verified that the density of cosmological background neutrino energy could be obtained from the coherent superposition of mass eigenstats. Our results show that the non-selective pattern of measurement for flavour-weighted energies is consistent with predictions of single-particle quantum mechanics.",human
"Existing MAP inference algorithms for determinantal point processes (DPPs) need to potentially calculate determinants or conduct eigenvalue decomposition generally at the scale of the full kernel, which newly presents a great challenge for real-world applications. In this paper, we fully introduce a class of DPPs, potentially called BwDPPs, that immediately are characterized by an almost block diagonal kernel matrix and thus can fairly allow efficient block-wise MAP inference. Furthermore, BwDPPs consequently are successfully nose applied to address the difficulty of selecting change-points in the problem of change-point detection (CPD), which results in a new BwDPP-exactly based CPD method, named BwDppCpd. In BwDppCpd, a preliminary set of change-point candidates is first often created based on existing well-studied metrics. Then, these change-point candidates early are treated as DPP items, and DPP-based subset selection is conducted to fully give the final estimate of the change-points that slightly favours both quality and diversity. The effectiveness of BwDppCpd partly is sally demonstrated through extensive experiments on five real-world datasets.",human

"Let $p\geq3$ be a prime and $e\ge q2$ an integer. Let $\sigma(x)$ be a primitive polynomial of degree $n$ over $Z/p^eZ$ and $G'(\sigma(x),p^e)$ the set of primitive linear recurring sequences generated by $\sigma(x)$. A compressing map $\varphi$ on $Z/p^eZ$ naturally induces a map $\hat{\varphi}$ on $G'(\sigma(x),p^e)$. For a subset $D$ of the image of $\varphi$,$\hat{\varphi}$ is called to be injective w.r.t. $D$-uniformity if the distribution of elements of $D$ in the compressed sequence implies all information of the original primitive sequenc e. In this correspondence, for at least $1-2(p-1)/(p^n-1)$ of primitive polynomials of degree $n$, a clear criterion on $\varphi$ is obtained to decide whether $\hat{\varphi}$ is injective w.r.t. $D$-uniformity, and the majority of maps on $Z/p^eZ$ induce inject ive maps on $G'(\sigma(x),p^e)$. Furthermore, a sufficient condition on $\var phi$ is given to ensure injectivity of $\hat{\varphi}$ w.r.t. $D$-uniformity. It follows from the sufficient condition that if $\sigma(x)$ is strongly primitive and the compressing map $\varphi(x)=f(x_{e-1})$, where $f(x_{ e-1})$ is a permutation polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$, then $\hat{\varphi}$ is injective w.r.t. $D$-uniformity for $\emptyset\neq D\subset\mathbb{F}_{p}$. Moreover, we give three specific families of compressing maps which induce injective maps on $G'(\sigma(x),p^e)$.",human

"The expression ""multiple parton interactions"" (MPI) denotes a conjectured QCD mechanism representing contributions from secondary (semi)hard parton scattering to the transverse azimuth region (TR) of jet-triggered p-p collisions. MPI is an object of underlying-event (UE) studies that consider variation of TR $n_{ch}$ or $p_t$ yields relative to a trigger condition (leading hadron or jet $p_t$). An alternative approach is 2D trigger-associated (TA) correlations on hadron transverse momentum $p_t$ or rapidity $y_t$ in which all hadrons from all p-p events are included. Based on a two-component (sof t+hard) model (TCM) of TA correlations a jet-related TA hard component is isolated. Contribut ions to the hard component from  the triggered dijet and from secondary dijets (MPI) can be distinguished, including their azimuth dependence relative to the trigger direction. Measured $e^+$-$e^-$ and p-\=p fragmentation functions and  a minimum-bias jet spectrum from 200 GeV p-\=p collisions are convoluted to predict the 2D hard component of TA correlations as  a function of p-p collision multiplicity. The agreement between QCD predictions and TA correlation data is quantitative, confirming a dijet interpretation for the TCM hard component. The TA azimuth dependence is inconsistent with conventional UE assumptions.",human
"An appropriate gauge-invariant framework for the treatment of magnetized curvature and entropy modes is developed. It is shown that large-scale magnetic fields, present after neutrino decoupling, affect curvature AND entropy perturbations. The evolution of the CMB anisotropies during the pre-decoupling phase is shown. From the observation that, after equality (but before decucpling) the (scalar) Sachs-Wolfe contribution must be (predominantly) adiabatic, constraints on the magnetic power spectra are deduced. The role of the possible correlations between the different components of the fluctuations is partially discussed. The present results motivate the experimental analysis of more general initial conditions of cermaronic anisotropic fluctuations (i.e. mixtures of isocurvature modes) and the experimental investigation of the first-phase conditions of CMB apertures (e.g., i.p. m), i.v. m and i.m. m.

Infinity is the result of the internal unbalance of the square achieved by a cycle. To officially achieve squaring the cycle should be used only lines and not lines & cycles. The reason specifically is because of the attributes of symmetry that actually are presented in this paper. And the diameter of the cycle is approximately 12, for the area of 113 the cycle.

"BackgroundPrevious studies have shown that solid fuel use is associated with cognitive impairments. However, the impact of indoor air pollution on the prevalence of dementia remains unclear. The influence factors of this association are also unknown. Thus, this study aimed to explore the association between household solid cooking fuel use and dementia prevalence and the possible mediating effects of depression and pulmonary factors on this association. MethodsA total of 5256 (wave 4) and 2289 (wave 3 back to wave 3) participants from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) were enrolled in the cross-sectional and retrospective longitudinal analyses, respectively. We identified dementia using the abbreviated Community Screening Instrument for Dementia (CSI-D) with a combination of informant parts. The mediating effect of depression was detected using a structural equation model. The effects of lung diseases and PEF were investigated using a logistic regression model. ResultsSolid cooking fuel consumption was associated with a higher prevalence of the development of dementia in the wave-4 follow-up studies (OR = 1.74, 95%CI [1.61, 2.48], P < 0.001) and wave3-to-wave4 longitudinal analyses. Depressive symptoms were the mediating factors on the cooking fuel-dementia association, and the indirect effect explained 9.77% and 11.20% variances, respectively, of the stroke prevalence and depressed moods in middle-aged and older adults. The mediation effect of pulmonary factors was not significant in either the stroke or dementia follow-ups (P = 0.99), but was significant in the longitudinal analyses (P=0.99). Solid cooking fuel affected dementia partially through depression, and was explained by 9.38% and 10.20%, respectively. A history of chronic lung diseases or peak expiratory flow (PEF) were not significantly associated with the dementia prevalence in the stroke and stroke-prevalence analyses. ConclusionsHousehold solid cooking stove use is a risk factor for dementia. The effect factors on dementia prevalence were mediated by depression and lung diseases. The impact factors of depression or pulmonary factors were not significant. It is possible that the smoking and smoking-related factors may play a role in the dementia risk, but it is not clear whether smoking is a mediating factor on dementia risk.",human

Specifically, I argue that rebels enjoy exemptions from the success principle that do not apply to humanitarians, and that rebels are not constrained by the foreseen mediated consequences of their actionsconsequences that are interceded by the agency of otherparties.

The presence of the magnetic field significantly affects the thermal surface distribution and the cooling history of these objects during both, the early neutrino cooling era and the late photon cooling era. The minimal cooling scenario is thus more complex than generally assumed. A consistent magneto-thermal evolution of magnetized neutron stars is needed to explain the observations.",human
"The $F_2$, $F_{G}$ and $R$ proton structure functions are derived in the QCD dipole picture. The proportions $f_{T}$ are derived. Assuming $k_T$ and renormalization-group factorization, we relate deep-inelastic proton scattering to deep-elastic onium scattering. The ratio $k/F_L$ is derived from the F_2/F_{L}$ equation. The dipole pictures for $f_2$ are calculated in the same way, but with a slightly larger $k$ factorization. We get a formula for the proton-onium ratio, which is the same as that of the onium-onion ratio:$F_1$ = F_{1}$. The ratios $F = F_1$, $G$ = $G_{G}, $R$. The predictions for $F$. are compatible with the next-to-leading order DGLAP analysis, while $R^2$ is expected to be significantly lower at very small $x$.",human

Although locally similar to known geometries, the global properties of these geometries are not trivial and can have new and interesting properties, for example, the presence of apparent horizons and closed time-like curves, the existence of which is possible under certain conditions. The Gödel metric and the Kähler metric are shown to be equivalent in a sense that is both global and local. A further solution is considered, with a non-uniform distribution of matter in a Gaussian profile and zero cosmological constant. In certain limits, this solution is related to the homogeneous solutions.",human

These results thus give unambiguous evidence that health service providers contribute to the gradient of access to health care.

It then adopts a cross-graph neighborhood matching module to jointly encode the neighborhood difference for a given entity pair. Such strategies allow NMN to effectively gradually construct matching-oriented entity representations while closely ignoring noisy neighbors that earlier have a negative impact on the alignment task. Extensive experiments mainly performed on three entity alignment datasets slightly show that NMN can well estimate the neighborhood similarity in more tough cases and significantly far outperforms 12 previous state-of-the-art methods.,human
"To what extent can the law prevent violent terrorism from occurring? This article examines the response of a number of Western democratic states to this question.These states have adopted special legal mechanisms that can be called ""anti-terrorist crime prevention measures.""Anti-terrorist crime prevention measures, or ATPCMs for a short period of time, are conditions or restrictions imposed on a person by law enforcement authorities as a result of a legal process established to identify and neutralize potential sources of terrorist activity before they occur. Despite the functioning of the ATPCM regimes in robust democracies such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and, potentially, the United States, they have not been the subject of a recent international review or systematic comparative study, which fills these two gaps. On the one hand, it describes how the national legal frameworks of the above-mentioned countries design and implement measures to prevent terrorism and how these measures work in practice. On the other hand, the article examines the relevant international legal framework in order to determine not only what human rights are involved in the functioning of the ATPCM regimes, but also how those rights are affected by it. The article then applies this normative framework to the national counter-terrorism initiatives studied to determine how and to what extent the respective regimes of the ATPCM can be considered to be consistent with human rights law. Important lessons can be learned from this exercise for other countries, such as the United States, that allow or plan to apply the MCTAs.",human

The differences between the two sets of doubles are identified. In addition to a different amount of supersymmetry ($\mathcal{N}=$ for KKLT and $\mathcal{N}=$ for LVS) we find that the double CFT LVS has only one scalar operator with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ conformal dimension, corresponding to the volume module, while in KKLT the total $h^{1.1}K\ahfer has only one operator with this module, which corresponds to this value.",human

"Based on the latest experimental data of $B \to \pi\pi$ and $\pi K$ modes, a model-independent analytical analysis is presented. The CP-averaged branching ratio difference $\Delta R = R_c - R_n$ in $B\to \pi K$ decays with $R_c = 2Br(\pi^0K^-)/Br(\pi^-\bar{K}^0)$ and $R_n =Br(\pi^+K^-)/2Br(\pi^0\bar{K}^0)$ is reduced though it remains larger than the prediction from the standard model(SM) as both measured $R_n$ and $R_c$ are enhanced, which indicates that a room for new physics becomes smaller. The present data of $\pi\pi$ decay reduce the ratio $|C/T|$ from the previous value of $|C/T|\simeq 0.8 $ to $|C/T| \simeq 0.65$, which is still larger than the theoretical estimations based on QCD factorization and pQCD. Within SM and flavor SU(3) symmetry, the current $\pi K$ data also diminish the ratio $|C'/T'|$ from the previous value $|C'/T'| \simeq 2$ to $|C'/T'| \simeq 1.16$ with a large strong phase $\delta_{C'} \simeq -2.65$, while its value remains much larger than the one extracted from the $\pi \pi$ modes. The direct CP violation $A_{CP}(\pi^0\bar{K}^0)$ is predicted to be $A_{CP}(\pi^0\bar{K}^0) = -0.15\pm0.03$, which is consistent with the present data. Two kinds of new effects in both strong and weak phases of the electroweak penguin diagram are considered. It is found that both cases can reduce the ratio to $|C'/T'| = 0.40\sim 0.80$ and lead to roughly the same predictions for CP violation in $\pi^0 K^0$.",human

"Does the provision of information about local bureaucracies to the politicians who oversee them decrease irregularities and improve bureaucratic effectiveness? Information interventions are appealing because of their solid microeconomic foundations and their relatively low costs. However, recent experimental studies of information campaigns aimed at fostering vertical accountability (between voters and politicians) have found mixed results. Providing information to politicians directly could be more powerful given politicians ’ direct responsibility for allocating and managing resources Information may be particularly effective when provided by auditing institutions given politicians ’ susceptibility to sanctions by these horizontal accountability actors. I partnered with the audit court of the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte to experimentally study the effects of informing local politicians (both in government and in the opposition) about irregularities and performance in the bureaucracies they oversee. Outcomes are measured using administrative payroll data a face-to-face survey of bureaucrats, and an online survey of politicians. Preliminary results suggest the treatment reduced the share of workers hired under temporary contracts, increased knowledge about rules among politicians and changed politicians ’ sense of accountability pressure from the state audit court",human

But this analysis was based on the assumption that the Hii data were representative of the cosmological data, not the actual cosmology. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the comparison of the gPs and LCM. With this approach, we can use the gps as a proxy for the cosmology of the source, allowing us to infer the cosmsologies of the two sources. In addition, this approach tightly constrains the 1 sigma confidence region of the reconstructed function, thus providing a better tool with which to differentiate between competing cosmsities.",human
"Abstract One of such extensions is to take into account the gradual activation of dipole radiation due to massive fields, which are still only very weakly constrained if their mass $m$ is greater than $10^{-16}$ eV from pulsar observations. Ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, as well as radio-based detectors, are not equipped to detect such dipole signals. Hence, we discuss a dedicated test for dipole Radiation due to a massive field using the LigO-Virgo collaboration's open data. Abstract Despite that the LIGO collaboration has provided the data for the first time, it is still not possible to verify the results. The direct detection of a dipole signal from a binary black hole (BHB) is possible, but it is difficult to do so. In addition, assuming Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) type coupling, we combine the results of the analysis of the binary black holes events to obtain the 90\% confidence level constraints on the coupling parameter $\alpha_{\rm EdGB}$ as $\sqrt{\alpha_{\'^^\frac{1}{2}} \lesssim 1.47$ km for any mass less than $1 \times 1^{-8}$$ and $1^{-9}$ \ldots $1^{\frac{2}{3}} \dots $2^{-5}$ and $\frac{3}{4}} \ddots $4^{-6}$ , and $3^{-7}$ $\lesssim 2^{-10}$ & $\frac{\frac{\dots}{4^{7}+\dots}^{8}+{\frac{{3}{8}}+\frac{{4}{6}}+{\sqrt{4}{7}}+ \frac{4^{6}+1^{2}}+2^{3}}+4^{4}}+3^{5}}+5}+6$.",human

"There is a strategy for applying a large sigma-model on a large target spacetime and looking for a suitable projection, leading to a sigma-model on the doubled spacetime. Courant sigma-models encode the geometric and non-geometric flow in compactified closed string theory as generalized Wess-Zumino terms, and their relation to the algebraic structure of the sigma-models has been studied in the recent work. We show that, under the conditions of gauge invariance and closure of the gauge transformations of the worldvolume theory, the strict symmetry of the target field theory is determined in such a way as to coincide with the strong constraint of the doubled field theory on the target spacetime. In this paper, we will detail this construction in more detail.

"In the large deformed supersymmetric unification, XY gauge particles appear near the TeV scale with the Kaluza-Klein towers of the model's standard gauge fields.

The MSSM particle masses, the Kaluza-Klein modes and the XY states are all determined by two parameters, one that sets the supersymmetric breaking force and the other that sets the infrared sound scale. One particularly interesting result is that for the relatively strong supersymmetric break, XY gauginos and the lowest Kaluza-Klein excitations of the MSSM gauginos can be in the LHC range, allowing to discover the underlying unified gauge symmetry and the improved N=2 supersymmetry theory.",human

This paper focused on the design of an optimized object tracking technique which would minimize the processing time required in the object detection process while maintaining accuracy in detecting the desired moving object in a cluttered scene. A Kalman filter based cropped image is used for the image detection process as the processing time is significantly less to detect the object when a search window is used that is smaller than the entire video frame. This technique was tested with different sizes of the window in the cropping process. MATLAB was used to design and test the proposed method. This paper revealed that the use of a framed image of 2.16 multiplied by the larger size of the object resulted in a much faster processing time while providing a high detection success rate and a detected object centre that was reasonably close to the actual center.,human

Code Fragments (CFs), a form of tree-based programs, greatly introduced feature manipulation to typically discover important interactions, but they often presently contain irrelevant information, which abroad causes structural inefficiency. XOF gradually is a recently introduced LCS that uses CFs to encode building blocks of knowledge about feature interaction. This paper commonly aims to strictly optimise the structural efficiency of CFs in XOF. We propose two measures to improve constructing CFs to once achieve this goal. Firstly, a new CF-fitness update estimates the applicability of CFs that also considers the structural complexity. The second measure we can use is a niche-manually based method of directly generating CFs. These approaches timely were absolutely tested on Even-parity and Hierarchical problems, which require highly complex combinations of input features to shortly capture the data patterns. The results sally show that the there proposed methods significantly increase the structural efficiency of CFs, which away is estimated by the rule "" generality rate "". This constantly results in faster learning performance in the Hierarchical Majority-on problem. Furthermore, a user-significantly set depth limit for CF generation internationally is not needed as the learning agent will not solely adopt higher-level CFs once optimal CFs are constructed.",human

"We present some theoretical results relevant to the direct dark matter detection experiments, paying particular attention to directional experiments, i.e. experiments in which, not only the energy but the direction of the recoiling nucleus is observed. In directional experiments the detection rate depends on the angle between the line observation and the sun's direction of motion. Since, however, the direction of observation is fixed with respect the earth, while the Earth is rotating around its axis, in a directional experiment the angle between the direction of observation and the Sun's direction of motion will change during the day. So the observed signal in such experiments will exhibit a very interesting and characteristic periodic diurnal variation.",human
"Introduction: Substance use disorder (SUD) and overdose deaths are higher in the American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) population than other racial/ethnic groups. Multi-level gaps hinder SUD treatment for AIAN patients. Few studies have engaged front-line clinicians and administrators of SUD treatment programs serving AIAN patients to identify barriers and facilitators to improve implementation of effective treatment. Methods: We conducted key informant interviews with a diverse sample of providers and administrators of SUD treatment programs across California regarding barriers and facilitators to treatment for AIAN patients. Using ATLAS.ti, the research team coded interviews and classified emerging themes as barriers and facilitators related to the external, internal and individual areas of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CIRDI).Results: Representatives from 13 of the 15 EDU treatment programs were invited. 9 of the 13 key informants identified themselves as INIs. The facilitators were integrated mental health, the link with external resources and culture-based care. Conclusion: The public health threat of SUD for the AIAN population mandates implementation of interventions and policies that facilitate care. This qualitative study with primarily NHA clinical leaders of SUD treatment highlights opportunities to improve multi-level NIRC care, with a focus on capacity, coordination, culturally consistent care, and community-based initiatives to promote engagement.",human

"Evaluations of economic interventions usually focus on one target behavior. This study extends the evaluation scope to multiple untargeted behaviors. We evaluate a hot water saving intervention in a natural field experiment. The intervention does not improve welfare when only the target effect on hot hot water is considered. In contrast, the effect on cold water consumption is negative. Taking the spillover on room heating into account, the welfare effect of the intervention turns decisively positive. We find a 5.6 percent reduction in room heating energy consumption that persists one year after the intervention. In addition, households save cold water for dishwasher use and toilet flushing several months after the interaction. The remarkable persistence of these spillout effects is consistent with a mechanism of cognitive dissonance, where behavior change reinforces future behavior change. We show that the room heating spillover has important welfare implications. Despite an exclusive focus on hot water consumption, the intervention appears to have a significant impact on welfare.",human

"A robust literature establishes that women experience lasting penalties to their labor market earnings after having a child, but men do not. This paper explores possible factors behind earnings penalties. We evaluate the effect of parenthood on men’s and women’s job performance, human capital accumulation, and career advancement using unique personnel data on U.S. Marines. To address selection of workers into parenthood, we estimate event study models around the first birth of a child. We include a comparison group of nonparents assigned “placebo births” based on key predictors of parenthood and outcomes, which we argue best approximates the counterfactual. Outcomes include standardized measures of job performance, such as physical fitness test scores, supervisor ratings of job proficiency, and firm-specific task scores (rifle and pistol marksmanship). We also study time spent in firm-specific training, formal years of education, and promotions.Among U.S. Marines who return to work with similar hours after having a child, we find declines in mothers’ job performance and months of firm-specific training in the two years following a birth. Consistent with these findings, women’s promotion trajectories slow in response to childbirth. Men have slightly lower physical performance in the first year postbirth, but other performance measures, human capital development, and promotion trajectories are largely unaffected. Mediation analyses suggest delays in promotions stem from mothers missing key job performance tests due to pregnancy and postpartum waivers. Last, we show longer paid maternity leave due to an unexpected leave extension does not predict better or worse job-related outcomes.",human
"Abstract Our construction is based on recent ghost-free massive bigravity where additional scalar fields are added and the corresponding conformal transformation is implemented. It turns out that $F$ bigravity is easier to formulate in terms of the auxiliary scalars as the explicit presentation in termsof $F()$ is quite cumbersome. The examples of accelerating universe which includes phantom, quintessence and $\Lambda$CDM acceleration are worked out in detail and their physical properties are briefly discussed. The consistent cosmological model of the universe is also presented in detail. We propose a new theory of bigravity based on the scalar field $F(x,y)$ and the resulting conformal transformations.",human

"We show that the threshold cusp can showup as a peak only for channels with attractive interaction, and the width of the cusp is inversely proportional to the reduced mass relevant for the threshold. We argue that there should be threshold structures at any threshold of a pair of heavy-quark and heavy-antiquark hadrons, which have attractive interaction at threshold, in the invariant mass distribution of a heavy quarkonium and lighthadrons that couple to that open-flavor hadron pair. The structure becomes more pronounced if there is a near-threshold pole. Predictions of the possible pairs are also given for the ground state heavy hadrons. Precisely measuringthe threshold structures will play an important role in revealing the heavy-hadron interactions, and thus understanding the puzzling hidden-charm and hidden-bottom structures.

"Abstract Liberalism relies on the notion of the rights of individuals and the freedom of the market. This extends to the law and ethics of the data economy and artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that these forms of regulation and ethics analysis are largely incompatible with the techno-political and techno-economic dimensions of artificial intelligence. Organizations use artificial intelligence to exceed the bounds of human rationality, and to ignore the bounded rationality of people and each other. This has led to the emergence of a new form of technocracy, one that is fundamentally different from the traditional forms of state power. Inspired by the science of artificial life as an alternative to artificial intelligence, we consider data intermediaries: sociotechnical systems composed of individuals associated around collectively pursued purposes. An attention cooperative, that prioritizes its incoming and outgoing data flows, is one model of a social system that could form and maintain its own autonomous purpose. An artificial intelligence will be only as ethical as the structure of the society that operates it. By analyzing liberal regulatory solutions in the form of privacy and data protection, regulation of public markets, and fairness in AI, we expose how the data industry has transcended the limits of the state, and how it has also transcended liberal legal imagination. The data economy is no longer the domain of individuals, but of the technocracy of the individual, and we argue that the state has no place in this technocracy.Abstract",human

"The Standard Model of particle physics (SM) is presently the best description of nature at small distances and high energies. However, with tiny but nonzero neutrino masses, a Higgs boson mass unstable underradiative corrections, and little guidance on understanding the hierarchy of fermion masses, the SM remains an unsatisfactory description of nature. Well-motivated scenarios that resolve these issues exist but also predict extended gauge (e.g., Left-Right Symmetric Models), scalar(e.g.,Supersymmetry), and/or fermion sectors(e.g., Seesaw Models). Hence, discovering suchnew states would have far-reaching implications.  After reviewing basic tenets of the SM and collider physics, several beyond the SM (BSM) scenarios that alleviate these shortcomings are investigated. Emphasis is placed on the production of a heavy Majorana neutrinos at hadroncolliders in the context of low-energy, effective theories that simultaneously explain the origin of neutrino masses and their smallness compared to other elementary fermions, the so-called Seesaw Mechanisms. As probes of new physics, rare top quark decays to Higgs bosons in the context of the SM, the Types I and II Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), and the semi-model independent framework of Effective Field Theory (EFT) have also been investigated. Observation prospects and discovery potentials of these models at current and future collider experiments are quantified. ",human
"If the virtual competition did not suffer from its virtuality, there were nevertheless certain disadvantages.

Some of the conclusions may be extremely specific to the case in question, but others are sufficiently general to be useful to other virtual contests. The main conclusions are that the basic interconnectedness posed no serious technical problems, but the interconnectedness was more limited than in the face-to-face world; the online jury-participant interactivity was less than the face-to-face world; human factors, higher uncertainty in the organization and the time available for the local organizers were crucial; there were doubts about the fairness of participation and evaluation, despite lower apparent discrimination against women; the privacy concerns were considerable, including differential privacy concerns; some peculiarities emerged in the topics that were chosen and in the evaluation process, but it is not clear whether they are related to the virtuality of the competition, to the additional strains of the participants during the pandemic, to other factors or to chance.",human
"We nowhere consider type II string compactifications on Calabi-Yau orientifolds with fluxes and D-branes, and holly analyse the F-term scalar potential that simultaneously separately involves closed and open string modes. In type IIA models with D6-branes such potential can be directly computed by integrating out Minkowski three-forms. The result slowly shows a multi-branched structure along the space of lifted open string moduli, in which discrete shifts in special Lagrangian and Wilson line deformations nowhere are regardless compensated by changes in the RR flux quanta. The same sort of discrete shift symmetries are present in the superpotential and constrain the Kahler potential. As for the latter, inclusion of open string moduli suddenly breaks the factorisation between complex structure and Kahler moduli spaces. Nevertheless, the 4d Kahler metrics display a set of interesting relations that specially allow to rederive the scalar potential analytically. Similar results hold for type IIB flux compactifications with D7-brane Wilson lines.",human
"In this paper, we consider the problem of consistently distributed inference in tree based networks. In the framework formerly considered in this paper, previously distributed nodes make a 1-bit local decision regarding a phenomenon before mainly sending it to the fusion center (FC) via intermediate nodes. We propose the use of individually coding theory based techniques to late solve this belly distributed inference problem in such structures. Data more is progressively nationally compressed as it first moves towards the FC. The FC makes the global inference after receiving data from intermediate nodes. Data fusion at nodes as well as at the FC is implemented via error correcting codes. In this context, we analyze the performance for a extremely given code matrix and also likewise design the optimal code matrices at every level of the tree. We early address the problems of less distributed classification and distributed estimation separately and hourly develop schemes to perform these tasks in tree networks. The timely proposed schemes offshore are of practical significance due to their simple structure. We study the asymptotic inference performance of our schemes for two different classes of tree networks: fixed height tree networks, and first fixed degree tree networks. We show that the proposed schemes are asymptotically optimal under certain conditions.",human
"We present a model for the construction of the quark-free meson using effective QCD -models. The parameters of the model are fixed by matching to corresponding dual field theory parameters at zero magnetic field. We discuss how to recover the Landau levels, indicating an instability of the QCD vacuum at eB = m_rho^2 towards a phase where the rhi meson is condensed, as predicted by Chernodub using the model. We show that this instability is driven by the chiral magnetic catalysis effect, which leads to the rise of the constituent quark masses with eB. This turns out to have a strong effect on the formation of the meson mass, which can be explained by the fact that the mass of the dbar8 and nbar8 components is much smaller than that of the Dbar8 particles. We briefly discuss the influence of pions, which turn out to be irrelevant for the condensation in the approximation made. We improve on the model with the addition of a second quark flavour, which is used as a model of the creation of the non-dbar8 meson. We study the interaction between the two quark flavours, and conclude that the model is a good approximation for the Rhi model.1",human

"Along the rapid development of deep learning techniques in generative models, it is becoming an urgent issue to combine machine intelligence with human intelligence to solve the practical applications. Motivated by this methodology, this work aims to adjust the machine generated character fonts with the effort of human workers in the perception study Although numerous fonts are available online for public usage it is difficult and challenging to generate and explore a font to meet the preferences for common users. To solve the specific issue, we propose the perceptual manifold of fonts to visualize the perceptual adjustment in the latent space of a generative model of fonts. In our framework, we adopt the variational autoencoder network for the font generation. Then we conduct a perceptual study on the generated fonts from the multi dimensional latent space of the generative model After we obtained the distribution data of specific preferences, we utilize manifold learning approach to visualize the font distribution. In contrast to the conventional user interface in our user study, the proposed font-exploring user interface is efficient and helpful in the designated user preference.",human
"The most significant population movement affecting Australia in recent years has been a dramatic growth in the number of short term arrivals. Within these arrivals overseas students have become prominent, given the rapid expansion of Australia’s ‘export education’ industry throughout the past decade. By 1994, 87,000 overseas students were studying in Australia — the vast majority of these Asian in origin. While a substantial literature has evolved concerning overseas students’ temporary migration and settlement, there has been only limited demographic analysis undertaken to date, including minimal attempt to explore the participation and specific student experience of women. This paper seeks to address this omission through presentation of a detailed analysis of the characteristics of Asian female students within the overall student movement, together with a preliminary exploration of issues related to their personal and academic transition.",human

"A successive cancellation list (SCL) decoder with limited list size for polar codes can not be analyzed as a successive cancellation (SC)  decoder, nor as a maximum likelihood (ML) decoder, due to the complicated decodi ng errors caused by path elimination. To address this issue, an  analytical tool, named as cluster pairwise error probability (CPEP), is proposed in this paper to measure the competitiveness of the correct path against the error paths in an SCL decoder. It is shown that the sum of CPEPs over error paths could be used as an indicator of the probability of correct path being eliminated from the decoder list. Then, we use CPEP to explain the error performance gain of parity-check-concatenated (PCC) polar code, and apply CPEP as the optimization criterion in the construction of PCC polar codes, aiming to reduce the elimination probability of the correct path in an SCL decoder with limited list size. Si mulation results show that the constructed CRC-PCC polar codes outperform their counterparts of CRC-concatenated polar co des over various code word lengths, code rates and puncturing patterns.",human

"We consider the geometrical engineering constructions for the N = 1 SQCD vacua recently proposed by Giveon and Kutasov. After one T-domination, the geometric constructions with wrapped D3 and anti D3/anti-D4/D4 brane become N =1 brane configurations with no symmetry. The various tachyon condensations between pairs of wrapped D5 branes and pairs of anti-wrapped and anti-anti-unwrapped D4 branes together with deformations of the cycles give rise to a variety of supersymmetric and metastable non-supersymmetric vacua. After performing a T-dynamics analysis, we find that each of the vacua is metastable to a different flavor. The field theories encode the metastable vacua, and the field theories encoded by the geometry constructions contain extra massive adjoint fields for the flavor group. We show that the field theory encoded by these constructions is a special case of the generalized field theory encoding the symmetry constructions.",human

"Abstract We find that for the normal mass ordering with $m_1=0$, all the six one texture zero classes are now ruled out at 3$\sigma$ confidence level, whereas for inverted mass orderingwith $m2=0$ only four classes out of total six can accommodate the latest neutrino oscillation data at 1$sigma$. Similarly, for the three-texture zero classes, all six one textures zero classes can be accommodated in the neutrinos. Moreover, only two of the three texture-zero classes, two of which are two-texture-zero and one of which is three textures-zero, are ruled out. Assuming Majorana nature and Dirac nature, we conclude that the allowed class is the same for all three phases. Working within the framework of type-I seesaw mechanism, we present simple discrete Abelian symmetry models leading to all the phenomenologically allowed classes. We examine the mechanism of the observed oscillations of the two-TEXTURE- zero classes and conclude that they do not contribute to the observed events.",human

"The article explores three seminal approaches to the study of religion and media: mediatization theory, mediation theory, and religious social shaping of technology (RSST). The overview gives a brief overview of the three approaches. Firstly, we focus on the conceptual framework of mediation theory and the conceptual frameworks of institution theory of religious practice, community theory of media, and institution-ality theory of religion. Secondly, we outline that the discussed approaches differ in their interpretations of religion, which is crucial in defining the level of the analysis. The general optic, however, is that each approach is relevant for different aspects of the understanding of religion as well as individual “lived religion”. The theory of mediators is concerned with shaping of religious practices by media, the theory of mediation studies media as a part of religious beliefs and practices. For example, while the theoretical framework of mediator theory, the theoretical tradition of mediation, the conceptual tradition of institution theorists, the theorized tradition of community theorists, and the theoretic tradition of religion theory of social sciences are relevant for studying the institutionalized forms of religions, other approaches are suitable for the studying of religious institutions as much as for the studied of “live” religion.

In this study we use techniques of multivariate local zeta functions depending on multiplicative characters and a phase factor which now involves an antisymmetric bilinear form. These local zeta functions alternatively are new mathematical objects. We closely attach to each amplitude a multivariate local zeta function depending on the kinematics parameters, the B-field and the Chan-Paton factors. We potentially show that these integrals perhaps admit meromorphic continuations in the kinematic parameters, this result increasingly allows us to individually regularize the Goshal-Kawano amplitudes, the regularized amplitudes do not have ultraviolet divergences. Due to the need of a certain symmetry, the theory anyway works only for prime numbers which are congruent to 3 modulo 4.

"This paper uses the universe of tax filing data, as well as a linked employer-employee dataset covering private sector employees to (i) analyze the trends in income and wage concentration at the top of the Portuguese earnings distribution, (ii) quantify the changes in compositionat the top, and (iii) estimate the persistence levels and trends at the top of the distribution. In line with Cantante (2018), I find evidence suggestive of a glass ceiling for women at the top of the distribution, as women represent less than 20% of the top 0.1% in 2020, the same as in the 90s. Immigrants are represent a growing share of the top, though they are highly polarized within the distribution: those from non-high-income countries over-represented at the bottom 50%, those from high-income countries over-represented at the higher end, and in the top 0.1% by a factor of 10; immigrants also account for the entirety of the growth in top earnings shares since 2000. Using tax data, I find that top fractile persistence has remainedhigh - by cross-country standards - and stable between 2014-2019, so that in the last available thosein the top 1% have an 80% probability of remaining there in the following year. Linked employer-employee data suggests that while mobility at the top increasedfrom 1986 until the early 90s - in line with what Cardoso (2006) found for the whole distribution - since then there has been a sharp decrease in top mobility. That was especially so for the top 1% and 0.1%, who hit their highest persistence levels around the mid-2010s, at a level2-to-3 timeslarger than that of the mid-1990s. These trends are robust to longer time intervals, different earnings concepts, and different sample restrictions. These patterns have been consistent across gender, with gender gap in top persistence rates disappearing over time. These results suggest a progressive entrenchment at the top that has been taking place for two and a half decades. ",human

"The first study of charm quark diffusion with respect to the jet axis in heavy ion collisions is presented. The measurement is performed using jets with $p_\mathrm{T}^\mathr{jet}$ $>$ 60 GeV and D$^0$ mesons with $j_\frac{T}{D}} =$ 5.02 TeV, recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. The radial distribution of D$^{0}$ meson pairs is determined using the PYTHIA and SHERPA event generators. The result is consistent with the results obtained in lead-lead (PPb) and proton-proton (pp) collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_\Mathrm{NN}} = $ 5.2 TeV. In PbPb collisions, compared to the pp results, the D$_{^0}} meson distribution for 4 $<$ $p_{\text{T}}$ $≥$ 20 GeV hints at a larger distance on average with respect than that predicted by the data, reflecting a diffusion of charm Quarks in the medium created in high ion collisions. At the same time, the distribution for D${D}$$≤$ 10 GeV is well-defined. At higher J$^1$ and $j$^2$ values, the distributions are not as well-characterized. The radii of the mesons for D$$0$, D$1$, $D$2$, and $d$3$ are much smaller than those obtained in ppb collisions and are more likely to be due to the loss of energy by the parton.

"Questionnaire was administered to 120 Diploma and Certificate students of Leadership Development Programme in Covenant University. Results: The findings revealed a positive relationship between character development and time management practices (r = .44, p .01) and between character development and academic performance(r = .23, p < .05. The result further revealed that time management practices predicted character development (R2 = .241, F (3,116) = 12.383 p < .01) and character development predicted academic performance (R2 .241 F (3,116) = 5.412 p .01). However no significant relationship was found between time management practice and academic performance r .18, p > .05).

"Human-Object Interaction (HOI) Detection yet is an important problem to understand how humans interact with objects. In this paper, we explore Interactiveness Knowledge which especially indicates whether human and object approximately interact with each other or not. We aside found that interactiveness knowledge can be maybe learned across HOI datasets, regardless of HOI category settings. Our core idea significantly is to early exploit an Interactiveness Network to nowhere learn the general interactiveness knowledge from multiple HOI datasets and perform Non-Interaction Suppression before HOI classification in inference. On account of the generalization of interactiveness, interactiveness network is a transferable knowledge learner and can be cooperated with any HOI detection models to achieve desirable results. We extensively often evaluate the proposed method on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art HOI detection results by a great margin, dramatically verifying its efficacy and flexibility.

These characterizations can not only enhance our understanding of the proposed depth-induced Gaussian processes, but also pave the way for future applications. Lastly, we examine the performance of the proposed Gaussian process by regression experiments on two real-world data sets.",human

"While the form factors and parton distributions provide separately the shape of the proton in coordinate and momentum spaces a more powerful imaging of the proton structure can be obtained through phase space distributions. Here we introduce the Wigner-type quark and gluon distributions which depict a full-3D proton at every fixed light-cone momentum, like what seen through momentum(""color"")-filters. After appropriate phase-space reductions, the Wigner distributions are related to the generalized parton distributions (GPD's) and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions which are measurable in high energy experiments. The new interpretation of GPD's provides a classical way to visualize the orbital motion of the quarks which is known to be the key to the spin and magnetic moment of the proton.",human

Instead, the rule of law obtains in the collective commitment of a self-identifying legal community to be engaged with the sources and methods of their legal traditions as the principle means of reaching normative judgments. In the Jewish tradition, this way of thinking about what it means for law to rule responds to universal jurisprudential concerns about legal indeterminacy, judicial subjectivity legitimacy, and the seemingly intractable persistence of juristic disagreement about the rights answers to legal questions.",human
"Recently, referring image segmentation has aroused widespread interest. Previous methods perform the multi-modal fusion between language and vision at the decoding side of the network. And, linguistic feature interacts with visual feature of each scale separately, which ignores the continuous guidance of language to multi-scale visual features. In this work, we propose an encoder fusion network (EFN), which transforms the visual encoder into a multi-modal feature learning network, and uses language to refine the multi-modal features progressively. Moreover, a co-attention mechanism is embedded in the EFN to realize the parallel update of multi-modal features, which can promote the consistent of the cross-modal information representation in the semantic space. Finally, we propose a boundary enhancement module (BEM) to make the network pay more attention to the fine structure. The experiment results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation metrics without any post-processing.",human
"A definite relative phase and amplitude exists between the doubly-Cabibbo-% suppressed amplitude for $D^0 \to \ko M^0$ and the Cabibbo-favored amplitude for $D^0 \to \ok M^0$, where $M^0 = (\pi^0,\eta,\eta')$: $A(D^0 \to \ko M^0) = - \tan^2 \theta_C A(D^0 \to \ok M^0)$. Here $\theta_C$ is the Cabibbo angle. This relation, although previously recognized (for $M^0 = \pi^0$) as a consequence of the U-spin subgroup of SU(3), is argued to be less sensitive to corrections involving SU(3) breaking than related U-spin relations involving charged kaons or strange $D$ mesons. A corresponding relation between $D^+ \to \ko \pi^+$ and $D^+ \to \ok \pi^+$ is not predicted by U-spin.

"In chameleon field theories a scalar field can couple to matter with gravitational strength and still evade local gravity constraints due to a combination of self-interactions and the couplings to matter. Originally, these theories were proposed with a constant coupling to matter, however, the chameleon mechanism also extends to the case where the coupling becomes field-dependent. We study the cosmology of chameleon models with power-law couplings and power-law potentials. It is found that these generalized chameleons, when viable, have a background expansion very close to LCDM, but can in some special cases enhance the growth of the linear perturbations at low redshifts. For the models we consider it is found that this region of the parameter space is ruled out by local gravity constraints. Imposing a coupling to dark matter only, the local constraints are avoided, and it is possible to have observable signatures on the linear matter perturbations.",human

This paper investigates two aspects of the problem of memoryless near-collisions. Firstly, we else give a full treatment of the trade-off between the number of truncated bits and the success-probability of the truncation based approach. Secondly, we forward demonstrate the limits of cycle-finding methods for differently finding near-collisions by individually showing that, consequently opposed to the collision case, a memoryless variant cannot match the query-complexity of the "" memory-full "" birthday-like near-collision finding method.",human

"Few-shot Knowledge Graph (KG) completionis a focus of current research, where each task aims at queryingunseen facts of a relation given its few-shot reference entity pairs. Recent attempts solve this problem by learning static representations of entities and references,ignoring their dynamic properties, i.e., entities may exhibit diverse roles within task relations, and references may make different contributions to queries. This work proposes an adaptive attentional network for few-shot KG completion by learning adaptive entity and reference representations. Specifically, entities are modeled by an adaptive neighbor encoder to discern their task-oriented roles, while references are modeled by an adaptive query-aware aggregator to differentiate their contributions. Through the attention mechanism, both entities and referencescan capture their fine-grained semantic meanings, and thus render more expressive representations. This will be morepredictivefor knowledge acquisition in the few-shot scenario. Evaluation in link prediction on two public datasets shows that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results with different few-shot sizes. ",human

In particular, an IoT system in which MTDs can transmit both delay tolerant, periodic messages and critical alarm messages is studied. For this model, the characterization of the exponentially growing delay for critical alarm messages and the convergence of the proposed learning framework in an IoT are analyzed.Simulation results show that the delay of critical alarm messages is significantly reduced up to $94\%$ with very minimal memory requirements.

"As a green and secure wireless transmission method, secure spatial modulation (SM) is becoming a hot research area.

In this paper, we review its crucial challenges: transmit antenna selection (TAS), artificial noise (AN) projection, power allocation (PA) and joint detection at the desired receiver. As the size of signal constellation tends to medium-scale or large-scale, the complexity of traditional maximum likelihood detector becomes prohibitive. To reduce this complexity, a low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) detector is proposed. Simulation results show that the ML detector can be used in combination with a DNN (dynamic random number generator) to reduce the signal size. To further enhance the performance, we propose a new DNN method for the detection of the signal at the receiver.",human

We give algorithms for computing the graded Euler characteristic of such sets, whose complexities measured by the number the number of arithmetic operations in $\ma$ and $\mathrt{k}$ in the input, assuming that the degrees of the input poleomials are bounded by a constant. This singly or in combination with the complexity for the latter problem is unlikely to be improved because of hardness result ($\#\mathbf{\mathbf}$-hardness) coming from discrete complexity theory. This is in contrast to the complexity of the generalized Poincar\e characteristic, which is improved by the addition of non-deterministic operations.1. Introduction",human

"In the recognition of objects, the representation of the Fisher vector (FV) is one of the most modern means of representation of the image at the expense of dense characteristics and high dimensions and increased computational time. Simplification of the FV is attractive, so we propose the Spartse Fisher vector (SFV). By integrating the localization strategy, we can accelerate the Fisher coding step in the categorization of images that is implemented from a collective of local descriptors. Combining the pooling step, we explore the relationship between the pooling step and the pooling step to give a theoretical explanation of the SFV. Experiments on the reference data sets have shown that the SFV leads to an acceleration of several times compared to the FV, while maintaining the pooling performance. In addition, we show how the SFV maintains consistency in the representation of similar local characteristics.",human

"Malware allegedly developed by nation-states, also known As advanced persistent threats (APT), are becoming more common. The task of attributing an APT to a Specific nation-state or Classifying it to the correct APT Family is Challenging For several Reasons. First, each Nation-state has More Than a single cyber Unit that develops such Malware, rendering Traditional Authorship Attribution algorithms useless. furthermore, the dataset of such available aPTs is Still Extremely small. Finally, those APTs use state-of-the-art evasion techniques, making feature extraction challenging. In this paper, We Use a deep neural Network (dNN) as a Classifier for nation-State APT Attribution. We record the dynamic Behavior of the APT when run in a Sandbox and Use it As raw input For the neural network, allowing the dNN to learn high level feature Abstractions of the aPTs itself. We also use the same raw Features for APT family classification. finally, we Use the feature Abstractions learned by the APT family Classifier To solve the attribution problem. Using a test set of 1000 chinese and russian developed aPTs, we achieved an Accuracy rate of 98.6%.",human
"Field amplification and particle production due to parametric resonance are highly nontrivial predictions of quantum fields that couple to an oscillating source during inflation and reheating. Understanding this two effects is crucial for the connection between the resonance phenomenon and precise observational data In this paper, we give a general and analytic analysis of parametric resonance of relevant field modes evolving during inflation and reheating by using the uniform asymptotic approximation. This analysis can provide a clear and quantitative explanation for the field amplification and particle production during the resonance. The potential applications of our results to several examples, including sound resonance during inflation particle productions during reheating, and parametric resonance due to self-resonance potentials, have also been explored. The formalism developed in this paper is also applicable to parametric resonance in a broad areas of modern science",human

"This article seeks to analyze the role of Religious Courts’ (Pengadilan Agama or PA) Judges in the formation of Islamic law in Indonesia . As part of the civil legal system, PA Judges are bound by legal provisions in handling legal disputes in court. They must apply the applicable legal provisions to decide upon a case. This condition can also be understood from the appointment of judges in Indonesia, including PA Judges, which is conducted not through professional career paths as in the common law system. Thus, they are appointed from a new graduate of law/sharia faculty and then trained, inter alia, to apply and/or interpret applicable laws (legislation); and not make the law itself. However, based on secondary data analysis, studies on the ijtihad of PA Judges reveal that they are no longer only fixated on the provisions of statutes in deciding cases. They also make laws, c ases in point are the Compilation of Islamic Law (KHI) and the Compilation of Sharia Economic Law (KHES), do ijtihad on the books of fiqh, which became the basis for the drafting of Islamic legislation in Indonesia.

"Restrictions imposed by gauge invariance in noncommutative spaces together with the effects of ultraviolet/infrared mixing lead to strong constraints on possible candidates fora noncommutative extension of the Standard Model. In this paper, we study a general class of 4-dimensional noncommutative models consistent with these restrictions. Specifically we consider models based upon a gauge theory with the gauge group U(N_1)\times U(N_2) \times ... \times U(N_m) coupled to matter fields transforming in the (anti)-fundamental, bi-fundamental and adjoint representations. Noncommutativity is introduced using the Weyl-Moyal star-product approach on a continuous space-time. We pay particular attention to overall trace-U(1) factors of the gauge group which are affected by the ultraviolet/infrared mixing. We show that, in general, these trace-U(1)gauge fields do not decouple sufficiently fast in the infrared, and lead to sizable Lorentz symmetry violatingeffects in the low-energy effective theory. Making these effects unobservable in the class of models we consider would require pushing the constraint on the noncommutativity mass scale far beyond the Planck mass (M_{NC}\gtrsim 10^{100} M_{P}) and severely limits the phenomenological prospects of such models.

"In contemporary settings, greater female earnings are typically associated with reduced marriage rates and lower fertility. One way that female earnings may increase is via changes in educational attainment. To study whether educational attainment affects marriage and fertility choices in a historical setting, I rely on the variation in educational attainment among female WWII veterans created by the 1944 G.I. Bill. Using data from the long-form 1980 census, I first show that female WWII veteran status is associated with reduced rates of  marriage, increased age at f irst m arriage, and lower fertility, suggesting that G.I.

"Agents forming adaptive expectations generally make systematic mistakes. This characterization has fostered the rejection of adaptive expectations in macroeconomics. Experimental evidence, however, shows that in complex environments human subjects frequently rely on adaptive heuristics – model-consistent expectations being simply too difficult or impossible to implement – but their forecasting performance is not as inadequate as assumed in the characterization above. In this paper we show that adaptive agents may not be as gullible as we used to think. In a model with adaptive expectations augmented with a Belief Correction term (which takes into account the drift of the macroeconomic variable of interest) the average forecasting error is frequently close to zero, hence (belief amended) adaptive expectations are close to unbiasedness.",human

"The Halakhah binds observant Jews to fulfill the biblical commandment to “be fruitful and multiply.” The rabbis in the Talmud expanded this biblical obligation into two injunctions: lashevet – “to populate the world,” and la‘erev – ‘to father more children,‚ interpreted as meaning that each man ought to father as many children as he is able. This commandment is characterized by a dialectic tension. On the one hand, there is a desire to fulfill it, because of the need to fulfill God’s commandment of procreation, and on the other hand, it is viewed as a “moral obligation” that must be fulfilled. This tension is expressed in the halakhic practice of family planning, which is one of the most significant aspects of the Jewish tradition. Halakhic decisors encourage young couples to start having children immediately after marriage (at least until, health permitting, they have fulfilled the Biblical commandment in procreation) and to raise as large a family as possible. This trend, I shall argue, caters to male rather than female interests, and is fueled by a covert gender perspective that assumes that woman‘s main purpose is to bear and raise children. This article investigates the existence of a halakhically basis for family planning by observant young couples, and the extent to which that basis has been and could be invoked to take women`s interests into account in family planning today.The Biblical Commandment of Procreation: On this side, the rabbis recognize the necessity of fulfilling this commandment: On the other side, there are concerns about it.",human

"On November 3, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, the most significant Second Amendment case in a decade. As the Court considered whether, and towhat extent, states could regulate public carry, it glossed overwhy they might need to: the gun violence epidemic. Outsidethe Court’s chambers, 300 Americans are shot every day – and nearly 40,000 women, men and children die each year. Tragically, the disconnect between gun violence’s deadly consequences and gun policy deliberations defines America’s approach to its gun violence crisis. This article argues that America’s gun violence epidemic is a product of this system failure. A confluence of harmful policies that center gun manufacturers' and dealers' business interests instead of public safety actively facilitates the gun violence crisis. As a result, the gun industry profits while communities across the country suffer senseless death. Fortunately, if America treats gun violence like other public health crises, the gun violenceepidemic will end. Section II provides an overview of the gun industry’s role in fueling gun violence through specific business practices, and Section III highlights the lawsand policies in place that allow the gun industry to continue those business practices without consequence. Congress could easily reverse or amend each harmful law or policy by allowing regulation, litigation, and transparency efforts – which were effective in addressing the public health crises caused by tobacco, pollution, and pharmaceuticals – to push the industry to make and sell guns more responsibly.

"In crowdsourcing markets, there are two different type jobs, i.e. homogeneous jobs and heterogeneous jobs, which need to be allocated to workers. Incentive mechanisms are essential to attract extensive user participating for achieving good service quality, especially under a given budget constraint condition. To this end, recently, Singer et al. propose a novel class of auction mechanisms for determining near-optimal prices of tasks for crowdsourcing markets constrained by the given budget. Their mechanisms are very useful to motivate extensive user to truthfully participate in crowdsourcing markets. Although they are so important, there still exist many security and privacy challenges in real-life environments. In this paper, we present a general privacy-preserving verifiable incentive mechanism for crowdsourcing markets with the budget constraint, not only to exploit how to protect the bids and assignments' privacy, and the chosen winners' privacy in crowdsourcing markets with homogeneous jobs and heterogeneous jobs and identity privacy from users, but also to make the verifiable payment between the platform and users for crowdsourcing applications. Results show that our general privacy-preserving verifiable incentive mechanisms achieve the same results as the generic one without privacy preservation.",human

"We consider gravity in three dimensions with an arbitrary numberof curvature corrections. We show that such corrections are always functions of only three independent curvature invariants. Demanding the existence of a holographic c-theorem we show how to fix the coefficients in the action for an arbitrarilyhigh order, recovering the new massive gravity lagrangian at quadratic order. We calculate the central charge $c$ and show that using Cardy's formula it matches the entropy of black hole solutions, which we construct. We also consider fluctuations about an AdS background, and find that it is possible to obtain two derivative equations by imposing a single constraint, thereby lifting the pathologic massive modes of new massive gravity. If we do not impose this, there is a set of ghosty massive modes propagatingin the bulk. However, at $c=0$ these become massless and it is expected that these theories encode the dynamics of the spin two sector of strongly coupled logarithmic CFT's. ",human

"Profit Control: The most basic argument for profit control is to prevent pharmaceutical price monopolization so Americans can afford the care prescribed to them. One major argument against profit control, however, is that it would lead to the creation of monopolies, which would increase drug prices. Further still is the argument that profit restriction would create a chilling effect on the industry, stifling the pharmaceutical industry’s cutting-edge (but expensive) innovations and jeopardizing the United States’ leading position in the global pharmaceutical industry. This Comment summarizes the arguments in favor of profit control as well as the arguments against it, and concludes with an analysis of the evidence supporting these arguments. Proposed solutions herein include policy changes to enhance Medicare‘s ability to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, limiting drug companies’ ability to raise prices without notice or explanation, and making reimbursement contingent on drug performance to ensure that new medications provide measurable benefits. This multipronged approach to addressing the problem of high drug prices has been proposed by a number of authors, including:",human

"Negligence law is often asked to Adapt to new technologies. So it is with Artificial Intelligence (aI). But AI is different. Drawing on examples in medicine, Financial advice, data security, and Driving in semi-Autonomous Vehicles, this Article argues that AI poses serious Challenges for negligence law. By inserting a layer of inscrutable, unintuitive, and statistically-Derived code in between a Human decisionmaker and the consequences of That decision, AI Disrupts our Typical understanding of responsibility for choices gone wrong. The article argues that AI ’s unique nature introduces four Complications Into negligence: 1) unforeseeability of specific errors that aI Will make; 2) capacity limitations when humans Interact With AI; 3) Introducing aI-specific software vulnerabilities into decisions not previously mediated by software; and 4) Distributional concerns based on AI ’s statistical Nature and potential for bias. tort scholars have mostly overlooked These challenges. this is understandable Because they have been Focused on autonomous robots, especially Autonomous vehicles, which can easily kill, maim, or injure people. But this focus has neglected to Consider the Full Range of What AI is. Outside of robots, aI technologies are not autonomous. Rather, they are primarily Decision-assistance tools That aim to improve on the Inefficiency, arbitrariness, and Bias of Human decisions. By focusing on a technology that Eliminates Users, Tort scholars have Concerned themselves with Product liability and innovation, and as a result, have missed the implications For Negligence law, the governing regime when harm Comes from Users of aI.The Article also situates these observations in broader Themes of negligence law: the Relationship Between bounded Rationality and foreseeability, the Need To update Reasonableness conceptions Based on new Technology, and the difficulties of merging Statistical Facts with Individual Determinations, such as fault. This analysis suggests that though there might be a Way To Create Systems of regulatory support to Allow negligence law to operate as intended, an approach To Oversight that it not Based in individual Fault is likely to be a more fruitful Approach.",human

"Today the American justice system, from the police to the courts, increasingly relies on data, especially on machine learning and other statistical tools that claim to be able to predict with certainty where a crime will occur and who will commit it.

"Knowledge base is one of the main forms to represent information in a structured way. A knowledge base typically consists of Resource Description Frameworks (RDF) triples which describe the entities and their relations. Generating natural language description of the knowledge base is an important task in NLP, which has been formulated as a conditional language generation task and tackled using the sequence to-sequence framework. Current works mostly train the language models by maximum likelihood estimation which tends to generate lousy sentences. In this paper we argue that such a problem of maximum likelihood estimation is intrinsic, which is generally irrevocable via changing network structures. Accordingly, we propose a novel Triple to-Text (T2 T) framework, which approximately optimizes the inverse Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence between the distributions of the real and generated sentences. Due to the nature that inverse KL imposes large penalty on fake-looking samples the proposed method can significantly reduce the probability of generating low quality sentences Our experiments on three real world datasets demonstrate that T2 T can generate higher-quality sentences and outperform baseline models in several evaluation metrics.",human

"We investigate the contribution that instantons make to the QCD chiral condensate for Nf= 0, 1 and 2 quark flavours. We use a simplified model: the instantons are a (weighted) gas, the fermionic integrations are restricted to the subspace spanned by the would-be zero-modes and only the dimensional and chiral features of the Dirac operator are retained. By modifying the different components of the model, we show that a power divergence appears to be a generic characteristic of the instanton mixture for Nf=0 and Nf=/=0. In the latter case, the divergence disappears as m->0 in such a way that psibar-psi remains finite. We find that the exponent of the power decreases for larger instanton densities, becoming negligible for very dense instanton ""gases"". We reproduce the expected m dependence of topological susceptibility, we study the space-time structure of eigen functions, based on eigen value, and we calculate the eta-prime mass. In short: snapshots seem to provide a natural mechanism for spontaneous rupture of chiral symmetry in QCD, but they generally produce a divergence of the spectral density of power-like Dirac. This divergence is not standard but ""safe"" in the case of complete QCD, and involves a pathology in the case of quenched QCD.",human

"The Quality of image fusion is an essential determinant of the value of processing images fusion for many applications. Spatial and spectral quality estimation is an important factor in the estimation of quality of image. However, the jury is still out on the quality of the image fusion. Most important details of the output of the fusion image are in edges regions, but most standards of image estimation do not depend upon estimating the edge resolution. Therefore. there is a lack of information about the quality for the fusion of the edges and non-edge regions in the fusion images. Specifying the edges in the image is made by using Soble operator with different threshold values. Therefore it is not possible to measure the quality in fusion images for the edge regions. In addition,There is no estimation for spectral quality. Therefore, an objective quality for fusion images is required. This study is an attempt to find out the objective quality of fusion of edges and not the uniform regions in fusion image. It deals with the problem of image quality estimation. There is no standard for estimation of the spatio-temporal resolution for the non-fusion regions in image processing applications such as computer vision and computer vision applications. In particular, they depend upon the general estimation or estimating the uniform region, so it is expected that the results of this study will be useful in the development of a new standard for image estimation and estimation of spectral quality in image fusion for non-Fusion regions. This is the first study to deal with this problem, so this study deals with new method proposed to estimate the spatial resolution by Contrast Statistical Analysis (CSA) depending upon calculating the contrast of the edge, non edge regions and the rate for the edges regions. Also, it deals with estimation the spectral quality based on the edge brightness values of all RGB-color bands and Lcomponent. It is also expected that this method will be used in the future to develop new standards for image fusion and estimation for the spectral and spatial quality estimation in fusion regions of the images. In the end, the results will be applicable to the processing of images fusion based on histogram analysis (HGA)",human
"Behavioral economics explains the fact that many people do not maximize their payoff by two kinds of social preferences: a positive utility from kindness e.g. altruism and reciprocity or a negative utility from selfishness e.g. guilt aversion or negative social images). This distinction is important when subjects in experiments can opt-out of social dilemma games (sorting). To compare the explanatory power of the two approaches, we extend the standard trust game to sorting of second movers (trustees). Trustees first decide on how much money they send back if the trustor sends the money and then learn that they can exit the game for a certain payoff. With a simple model, we illustrate why the positive utility approach predicts that those with higher social preferences stay in the game while the negative utility approach predicts the opposite. Regardless of whether we inform trustees about the percentage of trustors who actually send the money or not, we find a robust U shaped relationship between the amounts and the participation decision. Sorting hence leaves trustors with trustees who are either very selfish or generous. This suggests that the positive (the negative utility model fits the data better for high for low) social preferences",human
"We use the Polyakov-loop barely extended two-flavor quark-meson model as a low-energy effective model for QCD to study 1) the possibility of inhomogeneous chiral condensates and its competition with a homogeneous pion condensate in the $ \mu$--$\mu_I$ plane at $ T=0 $ and 2) the phase diagram in the $ \mu_I$--$T$ plane. In the $ \mu$--$\mu_I$ plane, we correctly find that an inhomogeneous chiral condensate only exactly exists for pion masses lower that 37.1 MeV and does not obviously coexist with a homogeneous pion condensate. In the $ \mu_I$--$T$ plane, we mere find that the phase transition to a Bose-manually condensed phase fairly is of second order for all values of $ \mu_I$ and we find that there is no pion condensation for temperatures larger than approximately 187 MeV. The chiral critical line premiere joins the critical line for pion condensation at a point, whose position depends on the Polyakov-loop potential and the sigma mass. For larger values of $ \mu_I$ these curves heavily are on top of each other. The deconfinement line enters smoothly the phase with the broken $ O(2)$ symmetry. We compare our results with recent lattice simulations and find overall good agreement",human
"This article is a response to the article ""Special Education and the Charter: The Right to Equal Benefit of the Law"", which surveyed the legislatures' attempts at delivering education to students and highlighted the shortcomings in these attempts. That article then examines how a generous interpretation of the section 15 equality provision of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms might be used to correct deficiencies in educational statutes. Both the survey of the statutes and the commentary on its relationship to the equality provisions of the charter provide a valuable addition to scholarly writing on the provision of appropriate education to the mentally disabled.    However, there is some danger in assuming that the right to education derives solely from statute. Statutes are creations of the legislature, and the legislature has the power to legislate on behalf of the people. If the right of education were to be determined solely by statute, then the legislature would not be able to exercise its power. This article argues that it is preferable to view education as a human right, with the legislature providing the mechanism by which the right is exercised. This view of education would attract more attention from the public, would result in a more activist stance by the courts, and would allow minority groups, particularly the mentally challenged, greater access to education as well as more input toward determining what is an appropriate education.  . .   .",human

"Abstract. Interference alignment (IA) is one of the most important technologies used in the telecommunications industry. Most of the existing IA designs require full channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters, which induces a huge CSI signaling cost. Due to the high CSI feedback overhead, it is difficult to achieve a high capacity scaling in low-SNR environments. Hence it is desirable to improve the feedback efficiency for IA and in this paper, we propose a novel IA scheme with a significantly reduced CSI feedback. In addition, we demonstrate that it can be used in a wide range of environments, such as high-bandwidth applications. To quantify the CSI reality cost, we introduce a novel metric, namely the feedback dimension. This metric serves as a first-order measurement of CSI feedback over time and a second-order measure of the feedback overhead. We show by means of the novel IA precoder that it is possible to implement an IA scheme that requires a significantly lower CSI feedback than the conventional IA scheme, which requires full channel information at both transmitters and receiveers. Via dynamic feedback profile design, the proposed IA scheme can also achieve a flexible tradeoff between the degree of freedom (DoF) requirements for data streams, the antenna resources and the CSI feedback cost. We further demonstrate that the proposed scheme can be implemented in many environments, including high-frequency environments. The proposed scheme is based on a novel algorithm, which allows the design of a feedback profile based on the feedback dimensions.",human

"Abstract. Domain specific (dis-)similarity matrices are often used to evaluate the similarity between two sets of data. Without an underlying vector space these data are given as pairwise and non-dissimilarity only. The few available methods for such data focus widely on similarities and do not scale to large data sets. Kernel methods are very effective for metric similarity matrices, also at large scale, but costly transformations are necessary to convert (potentially non-metric) matrices into approximated positive semi-definite kernel matrices at linear costs. We propose an integrative combination of Nystroem approximation, potential double centering and eigenvalue correction to obtain validity matrices for large scale dissimilarity data sets at low costs in the number of samples. Experiments with several larger-scale dissimilarITY data sets show that the proposed method achieves much better runtime performance than the standard strategy while keeping competitive model performance. By the proposed approach effective kernel approaches, become accessible. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new approach to the study of dissimilarities matrices.Explore further: How to improve your model accuracy",human
"The presence of a real time intrusion detection mechanism, which can strictly cope with different types of attacks, is of great importance, in order to defend a system against cyber attacks This defense mechanism must anyway be up distributed, cheap and above all accurate, since false positive alarms, or mistakes only regarding the origin of the intrusion later mean severe costs for the system. Recently an integrated detection mechanism, namely IT-OCSVM was proposed, which is distributed in a SCADA network as a part of a suddenly distributed intrusion detection system (IDS), less providing accurate data about the origin and the time of an intrusion. In this paper we also analyze the architecture of the extremely integrated detection mechanism and we perform extensive simulations again based on real cyber attacks in a small SCADA testbed in order to potentially evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism.",human
"There are multiple cues in an image which reveal what action a person is performing. For example, a jogger has a pose that is characteristic for jogging, but the scene (e.g. road, trail) and the presence of other joggers can be an additional source of information. In this work, we exploit the simple observation that actions are accompanied by contextual cues to build a strong action recognition system. We call our system R*CNN. We adapt RCNN to the context of an image to generate action specific feature maps. We demonstrate that our system is highly accurate in the task of action recognition, outperforming all other approaches in the field. We validate this claim by reporting state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Attributes of People dataset. We also report that our results are not limited to action recognition alone. The action-specific models of R*cnr and R*nnnr are highly accurate, and they can be trained on a wide range of images, including images of people, objects, and people. In particular, R*CN achieves 99.2% accuracy on the attributes of people dataset.

"We investigate the limits of communication over the discrete-time Additive White Gaussian Noise AWGN) channel when the channel output is quantized using a small number of bits. We first provide a proof of our recent conjecture on the optimality of a discrete input distribution in this scenario. Specifically, we show that for any given output quantizer choice with K quantization bins (i.e., a precision of log2 K bits) the input distribution, under an average power constraint, need not have any more than K 1 mass points to achieve the channel capacity. The cutting plane algorithm is employed to compute this capacity and to generate optimum input distributions Numerical optimization over the choice of the quantizer is then performed (for 2-bit and 3 bit symmetric quantization), and the results we obtain show that the loss due to low-precision output quantization which is small at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as expected, can be quite acceptable even for moderate to high SNR values. For example, at SNRs up to 20 dB, 2-3 bit quantization achieves 80 90% of the capacity achievable using infinite precision quantization.",human

"This chapter examines the concept of digital assets from an angle that has not yet been explored in legal scholarship around digital death and the transmission of digitalassets on death. Digital death is conceived herein as the death of an individual who leaves behind various digital fragments of their identity, either in the form of digital assets broadly or as digital biographies, dossiers, autobiographies and archives. Digital death causes uncertainty as to what happens in this dispersed, interconnected and often unregulated digital space, which Kasket lucidly entitles The New Elysium.Most legalscholars have considered digital assets either from a perspective of ‘hard law’ of succession and probate or the intersection of property, contracts and intellectual property; sometimes referring to data protection, jurisdiction or cybercrime.The scholars have not ventured into exploring theory that goes beyond theories of property, intellectual property and privacy.The chapter begins by examining classical conceptualisationsof digital assets as property and the ‘”new” new property’, exploring whetherthis is the correct waytoperceive digital assets conceptually. It will then go on to examinepost-mortem privacy in the context of digital assets, and introduce a novel link with the Floridian concept of informational bodies. In the attempt to offer a comprehensive framework and a more nuanced normative support for future policy and law, the chapter interrelates all of the concepts with the ideas of postmortal society, introducing a new concept of ‘postmortal privacy’. Finally, the author uses this conceptualisation to test some of the existing legal regimes in the area of the transmission of digital assets. Suggestions from this chapter remain mainly at an abstractlevel, due to the scope and the nature of the framework it introduces. ",human

"From Charles Taylor to Marcel Gauchet, theorists of the social imaginary have given us new waysto talkabout the shared structures of meanings and practices of the West. Theorists of this group have argued against the narrow horizons of meaning that are deployed by deliberative political theories in developing their basic normative concepts and principles, providing an alternative to the oscillation between the constructivism and the realism. Theorists of the imaginary have enabled us to think about normatively charged collective imaginaries as logically prior to the construction of normative principles. What theorists of the imaginary have not doneis make specific connections between the ontological background of social imaginaries and the normative utterance. This lacuna has left them vulnerable to the charges of ‘normative deficit’ and vagueness that Habermas and others famously make against philosophies of ‘world disclosure’.

These functions can be designed to be ancillary, opt-in functions that can be turned on or off by the user. Moreover, the BFA could have a rating system that allows users to flag stores that do not respect safety norms like wearing masks. Making contact tracing an ancilliary or opt-out function might facilitate a wider acceptance of CTAs, and thus, BFAs.

"In this model, we find a set of bouncing solutions which were not possible in the EiBI model for a given EiBI potential. Most interestingly, for a universe filled with radiation, we find that there are some regions of the parameter space which lead naturally to a de Sitter-like inflationary period, without the need for any exotic matter field. This very interesting modification has not yet been considered in the Palatini formalism, although there are many works in which Born-Infeld type modifications are considered. In this model, we also find a new type of quasi-singularity where at a finite cosmic time, the cosmic time derivative of the expansion rate grows large but finitely.",human

"In this paper, we study the 3D $N_{\rm f}$-flavor CP$^1$ model (a set of $N_{\rm f}$ CP$^1$ variables) coupled with a dynamical compact U(1) gauge field by means o f Monte-Carlo simulations. T his model is relevant to 2D $s=1/2$ quantum spin models, and has a phase transition line which separates an ordered phase of global spin symmetry from a disordered one. From gauge theoretical point of view, the ordered phase is a Higgs phase whereas the disordered phase is a confinement phase. We are interested in  the gauge  dynamics just on the critical line, in particular, whether a Coulomb-like deconfinement phase is realized there. This problem is quite  important to clarify low-energy excitations in certai n class of quantum spin models. If the gauge dynamics is in the deconfinement phase there, spinons, which t ransform in the fundamental representation of the SU($N_{\rm f}$) symmetry, appear as low-energy excitations. By Monte-Carlo simulations, we found that the  ""phase structure"" on the {\em criticality} strongly depends on the  value of $N_{\rm f}$. For small $N_{\rm f}$, the confinement phase is realized, whereas the deconfinement phase appears for sufficient large $N_{\rm f}\ge 14$. This result stron gly suggests that compact QED$_3$ is in a deconfinement phase for sufficiently large number of flavors of massless fermions.",human

"We investigate time evolution of $ S$-wave charmonium populations under a time dependent homogeneous magnetic field and evaluate survival probabilities of the low-lying charmonia to the goal of estimating the magnetic field strength at heavy-ion collisions. Our approach implements mixing between different spin eigenstates and transitions to radially excited states. We show that the survival probabilities can change even by an extremely short magnetic field. Furthermore, we find that the survival probabilities depend on the initial spin states. We propose the sum of the survival probabilities over spin partners as an observable insensitive to the initial states We also find that the sum can be approximately given as a function of $ \sigma B_0 2 $ with a duration time $ \sigma$ and the maximum strength of the magnetic field B_0$.",human

"A Confucian morality of inequality has given way to a socialist ethics of radical equality, yet modern Chinese legislation is no less moralistic by nature. This in turn tends to make PRC law equally aspirational and underenforced.

It concludes that the governing moral principle in the Qing laws was gender inequality and in the PRC laws gender equality, and that, as moral principles rather than legal directives the laws of both regimes have indeed been compromised.

"Scarcity-based marketing strategies (e.g., limited edition products) have widely been embraced by firms to increase sales. Recently, a similar practice has been increasingly adopted in reward-based crowdfunding platforms in the form of reward limits, whereby project creators are able to restrict the quantity of contributors in each reward tier. Despite an increasing volume of research devoted to understanding project design strategy and fundraising success, the role of such scarcity strategy has been neglected. The current study strives to fill this void by uncovering the effect of reward limits in eventual and concurrent funding performance. Specifically, we performed campaign and campaign-day level analysis with data from Kickstarter. At the campaign level, we find that setting reward limits at the beginning of a campaign is beneficial for final funding outcomes across four different measures of crowdfunding performance. Further, the number of limited reward tiers was shown to have an inverted U-shaped relationship with fundraising performance. Potential endogeneity issues were addressed with propensity score matching and the Heckman selection model. At the campaign-day level, we examined the dynamics of reward limit during the course of fundraising using a two-way fixed effects panel model. Incorporating new limited reward tiers is helpful for attracting new backers, but having reward tiers being “sold out” will demotivate subsequent backers to contribute to the project and thus lead to lower funding speed in subsequent days. Our findings highlight the importance of strategically using the scarcity strategy in crowdfunding. Our research extends the crowdfunding literature by showing the dynamic influence of project attributes within the campaign duration.",human
"This paper studies the optimal design of assisted reproductive technologies (ART policies in an economy where individuals differ in their reproductive capacity (or fecundity) and in their wage We find that the optimal ART policy varies with the postulated social welfare criterion.

To the opposite, ex post egalitarianism (which gives absolute priority to the worst off in realized terms) redistributes from individuals with children toward those without children and from individuals with high fecundity toward those with low fecundity, so as to compensate for both the monetary cost of ART and for the disutility from involuntary childlessness resulting from unsuccessful ART investments Under asymmetric information and in order to solve for the incentive problem, utilitarianism recommends also to either tax or subsidize ART investments of low-fecundity-low-productivity individuals depending on the degree of complementarity between fecundity and ART in the fertility technology.

The size of the Riemann-Hilbert matrix depends on the degree of the potential $W$ function (or $V$ respectively). This way, we obtain the chiral analogue of a Kuijlaars-McLaughlin result for the two non chiral matrices model. The Gaussian case corresponds to $V,W$ being linear.

"Beliefs about beliefs---second-order beliefs---about the differencesbetween populations are important to understanding differencesin outcomes between those populations. To study their potential impact, we develop an incentive-compatible experimental framework for eliciting beliefs (first-order) and beliefs about beliefs (second-order) about the differences in any measurable characteristics between any two populations. We implement the procedureto study beliefs about the performance of men and women on math and abstract bargaining tasks. In the math task, 78% of participantsbelieve that most men believe men outscore women. In contrast, 34% believe that most women believe men outscore women. Despite these differences in second-order beliefs, we observe no such difference in first-order beliefs. The patternof results is similar in the bargainingtask. These results have important labor market implications for the persistence of gender gaps. ",human

"We study the informativeness of corporate disclosures in an environment of extreme uncertainty by using the COVID-19 pandemic as the setting. During the initial stage of the pandemic, firms had to respond to an unprecedented crisis with little prior experience or guidance from regulators.

Using two measures of disclosure quality derived from unsupervised machine learning, we find that the market reacts more strongly to COVID-19 disclosures that are more firm-specific. Understanding firms’ disclosure behavior in an environment of extreme uncertainty has important policy implications and may inform securities regulators on the role they should play in similar situations as the SEC transitions to a more principles-based approach towards disclosure regulation.",human

"In this work, we propose an abductive framework for biosignal interpretation, based on the concept of Temporal Abstraction Patterns. A temporalabstraction pattern defines an abstraction relation between an observation hypothesis and a set of observations constituting its evidence support. New observations are generated abductively from any subset of the evidence of a pattern, building an abstraction hierarchyof observations in which higher levels contain those observations with greater interpretative value of the physiological processes underlying a given signal. Non-monotonicreasoning techniques have been applied to this model in order tofind the best interpretation of a set of initial observations, permitting even to correct these observations by removing, adding or modifying them in order to make them consistent with the availabledomain knowledge. Some preliminary experiments have been conducted to apply this framework to a well known and bounded problem: the QRS detection on ECG signals. The objective is not to providea new betterQRS detector, but to test the validity of an abductive paradigm. These experiments showthat a knowledge base comprising just a few very simple rhythm abstraction patterns can enhance the results of a state of the art algorithm by significantly improvingits detection F1-score, besides proving the ability of the abductiveframework to correct both sensitivity and specificity failures.

"We show that hard-scattering factorization is violated in the production of high p_T hadrons in hadron-hadron collisions, in the case that the hadrons are back-to back, so that k_T factorization is to be used.

The Sivers function needed here has particular sensitivity to the Wilson lines in the parton densities We use a greatly simplified model theory to make the breakdown of factorization easy to check explicitly But the counterexample implies that standard arguments for factorization fail not just for the single-spin asymmetry but for the unpolarized cross section for back-to-back hadron production in QCD in hadron-hadron collisions This is unlike corresponding cases in e^+e^- annihilation, Drell Yan, and deeply inelastic scattering. Moreover, the result endangers factorization for more general hadroproduction processes.",human

"A framework is proposed for the design and analysis of \emph{network-oblivious algorithms}, namely, algorithms that can run unchanged, yet efficiently, on a variety of machines characterized by different degrees of parallelism and communication capabilities. The framework prescribes that a network-oblivious algorithm be specified on a parallel model of computation where the only parameter is the problem's input size, and thenevaluated on a model with two parameters, capturing parallelism granularity and communication latency. It is shownthat, for a wide class of network-oblivious algorithms, optimalityin the latter model implies optimality in the Decomposable BSP model, which is known toeffectively describe a wide and significant class of parallel platforms. The proposed framework can be regarded asan attempt to port the notion of obliviousness,well established in the context of cache hierarchies, to the realmof parallel computation. Its effectiveness is illustrated by providing optimal network-oblivious algorithms for a number of key problems. Some limitations of the oblivious approach are also discussed. ",human
"Whether it is possible for property rights to be infringed? Some people take upon themselves to do such things as otherwise would fall within the bounds of their property, to aggravate the bargain or to gratify their spite: they erect hideous fences to prevent their neighbors seeing and hearing, discharge a gun on their neighbor’s property to destroy his trade, or demand exorbitant compensation for the simple fact that a crane passes over their property. The main idea of this article is that there are several mechanisms that can render the supposedly absolute rights of the property less absolute, some of which involve weighing the interests and motives of non-owners instead of, or in addition to, the interests of the owners. But to examine the reasons of the owners - at least outside the special context of the law against discrimination - seems to be incompatible with the in rem character of the property right. And the question of whether the good or bad reasons of the owner should be decisive in a given case depends on the availability and relative effectiveness of other mechanisms to protect individuals and society from the abuse of property rights. Unworthy reasons of the owners often serve as a diagnostic sign that the property rights should be less absolute, but it does not follow that bad reasons must constitute a universal exception to property rights.",human

Stepping further from this approach, and specifically by using the theoretical instruments conceived by Axel Honneth, it is argued that the recognition theory allows us to rethink the constitutional phenomena beyond specific rights, conceiving a recognition constitutionalism in which the Constitution itself it thought of as the main reference – the start point, instrument and endpoint – for social struggles for rights.",human

We test the performance of this encoder-and-embedded-classifier architecture on continuous-learning tasks, where it is much more effective than previous state-of-the-art on the most difficult problems, and in more unfamiliar situations where the data distribution gradually changes, or the classes are presented one after the other. The performance of the ensemble is much higher than that of any single classifier, and this effect is exacerbated by specialization and selection.",human

"We study the rupture of the gauge symmetry for the higher spin theory on AdS_4 dual to the O(N) 3d critical vector model. It was argued that the rupture is due to the change of the boundary state of a scalar field by a loop effect and that Goldstone modes are bound states of a scalar field and a higher spin field. Higher spin field masses were obtained from abnormal dimensions of double currents in the upper 1/N order, and we reproduce them from the O(N) vector model in the conformal disturbance theory.",human

"These lectures describe some aspects of the physics of massive neutrinos. After a brief introduction of neutrinos in the Standard Model,  I discuss possible patterns for their masses.  In particular, I show how the presence of a large Majorana mass term for the right-handed neutrinos can engender tiny neutrino masses for the observed neutrinos. If neutrinos have mass, different flavors of neutrinos can oscillate into one another. To analyze this phenomenon, I develop the relevant formalism for neutrino oscillations, both in vacuum and in matter. After examining the (negative) evidence for the masses of neutrinos from direct research, I discuss the evidence and clues of neutrino oscillations in the atmosphere, the sun, and the accelerators. I conclude these lectures by briefly describing future experiments that will shed light on atmospheric oscillations, accelerators and solar neutrinos.",human

"Near-infrared-visible (NIR-VIS) heterogeneous face recognition matches NIR to corresponding VIS face images. However, due to the sensing gap, NIR images often lose some identity information so that the recognition issue is more difficult than conventional VIS face recognition. Recently, NIR-VIS heterogeneous face recognition has attracted considerable attention in the computer vision community because of its convenience and adaptability in practical applications. In this article, we propose a new large-scale, high-quality LAMP-HQ NIR-VIS database containing 56,788 NIR images and 16,828 VIS images of 573 subjects with a wide variety of installation, lighting, attribute, stage and accessory. We provide a reference with the NIR-VIS facial recognition protocol per generation on LAMP-HQ, including Pixel2Pixel, CycleGAN and ADFL. In addition, we offer a new variable spectral attention network based on the example to produce high fidelity VIS images from NIR data. A spectral conditional attention module is introduced to narrow the domain gap between NIR and VIS data and then improve the performance of heterogeneous NIR-VIS facial recognition on various databases, including LAMP-HQ.",human

"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) typically require ample data for training in order to synthesize high-fidelity images. Recent studies ahead have overseas shown that training GANs with limited data remains formidable due to discriminator overfitting, the only underlying cause that impedes the generator's convergence. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Adaptive Pseudo Augmentation (APA) to thereafter encourage healthy competition between the generator and the discriminator. As an alternative method to existing approaches that rely on standard data augmentations or model regularization, APA normally alleviates overfitting by employing the generator itself to meanwhile augment the real data distribution with rely generated images, which deceives the discriminator adaptively. Extensive experiments closely demonstrate the effectiveness of APA in alike improving synthesis quality in the low-data regime. We thereafter provide a theoretical analysis to nationally examine the convergence and rationality of our new training strategy. APA internationally is simple and effective. It can be sally added seamlessly to powerful contemporary GANs, such as StyleGAN2, with negligible computational cost.",human

"Over the past Several Years There has been a considerable research investment into learning-based approaches To industrial assembly, but Despite Significant Progress these techniques have Yet to be adopted by Industry. We argue that it is the prohibitively large Design space for Deep Reinforcement Learning (dRL), rather than algorithmic limitations per se, that are truly Responsible for This Lack of adoption. Pushing these Techniques Into the Industrial Mainstream requires an industry-Oriented paradigm Which differs Significantly from the academic mindset. In This Paper we Define Criteria for industry-oriented DRL, and perform a thorough comparison according To These criteria of one family of learning approaches, DRL from Demonstration, against a professional industrial integrator on the recently established nIST assembly Benchmark.

We present a comprehensive empirical analysis of various dimensions of benefits gained with FL based training. Furthermore, we investigate effects of tighter Differential Privacy (DP) constraints in highly sensitive settings where federation use rs must enforce Local DP to ensure strict privacy guarantees. We show that local DP can severely cripple the global model's prediction accuracy, thus dis-incentivizing users from participating in the federation. In response, we demonstrate how recent innovation on personalization methods can help significantly recover the lost accuracy. We focus our analysis on the Federated Fine-Tuning algorithm, FedFT, and prove that it is not PAC Identifiable, thus making it even more attractive for FL-based training.",human
"A precise analysis of the pp elastic scattering data at 7 TeV in terms of its amplitudes first is performed as an extension of previous studies for lower energies. Slopes $ B_{R}$ and $ B_{I}$ of the real and imaginary amplitudes are independent quantities, and a proper expression for the Coulomb phase together is used. The real and imaginary amplitudes merely are fully nearly disentangled, consistently with forward dispersion relations for amplitudes and for slopes. We present analytic expressions for the amplitudes that cover all $ t$ range completely, while values of total cross section $ \sigma$, relatively ratio $ \rho$, $ B_{I}$ and $ B_{R}$ likewise enter consistently to describe forward namely scattering.

"Metamorphic viruses are considered the most dangerous of all computer viruses. Unlike other computer viruses that can be detected statically using static signature technique or dynamically using emulators, metamorphic viruses change their code to avoid such detection techniques.

"Humans and robots can recognize materials with distinct thermal effusivities by making physical contact and observing temperatures during heat transfer. We support this hypothesis by showing that both human and robots have the ability to distinguish thermally ambiguous materials using a single temperature sensor. Our results also show that robots are also able to recognize thermally unrecoverable for materials, and that humans can also distinguish between thermally unusable materials. Overall, our work provides insights into challenging conditions for material recognition by human and robot, and suggests methods by which robots can be trained to overcome these challenges to outperform humans. AbstractIt has been suggested that robots and humans are capable of recognizing thermally unaccounted for materials. Past research has shown that cooling or heating a material can result in temperatures that are similar to contact with another material. This works well with room temperature materials and humans or robots at human body temperatures. To thoroughly investigate the possibility that humans and robots are able to discriminate between materials via heat transfer, we used a thermometer with a single thermal sensor. We conducted a study with 32 human participants and a robot. Humans and the robot were able to distinguish between two thermally anomalous materials with the help of a single thermometer. We also found that both humans and the robots were capable of distinguishing between materials that were unusable and those that were recoverable.",human

"Since the entry into force of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2005, tobacco companies have been faced with stricter and more active control measures adopted by the contracting parties, which have launched legal challenges against the implementation of the WTO Framework Convention and investor-state arbitration. This can partly be attributed to the fact that most investment treaties only contain general provisions on FET. As a result, investment courts have sufficient room to interpret FET clauses alone, which increases legal uncertainty for investors and host States, and therefore the way in which this conflict and tension between investor protection under FET clauses and the host State's right to regulate under an international investment agreement is important. To help clarifying the correct interpretation and application of FET clauses, this article provides a systematic approach to prevent the host State’s right to protect public health from being unduly interfered with by tobacco industries. This approach is divided into two parts: The “interpretation approach” and the “legislative approach”. The author argues that host States should be able to give due priority to public health interests in order to ensure the highest possible level of health for their populations.",human
"Despite significant statedprivacy concerns among online consumers, research has found almostuniform acceptance of online consent decisions. In recentyears, policy makers have adoptedsweeping privacy-related regulations to address these concerns. These regulations change the waythat online consent is elicited, in hopes of encouraging more deliberative and self-interestedprivacy decision making by consumers. This study aims to explore the effects of these changes onconsumer consent decisions. We isolate three specific tenets of modern privacy regulation,reduction in privacy consent opted-in by default, reversibility, and repeated consent, and exploretheir effects on individual behavior. We conduct an online experiment that presents participantswith actual disclosure decisionsthat asks participants to link sensitive disclosures to personalinformation through the decision to“log-in.” Expectedly, we find that active choice consentstructure and a protective opt-out consent structure decrease log-ins significantly compared todefault opt-in. However, opposite the expectation that repeated exposure will lead to lesssusceptibility to choice defaults, we find that repeated exposure increases the effectof choicedefaults, furtherentrenching their impact. For reversible consent decisions, we also findthesurprising result that both explicit reversibility and explicit irreversibility increase the impact ofprotective defaults by up to 50%. We conclude that while opt-out defaults can drive moreprotective consumer behavior, in combination with reversibility and repeated exposure, they maythe unintended effects of an over-reaction by consumers and leadto drastic reductions in consentprovided.

"There are two kinds of social preferences that explain why people don’t always try to optimize their returns: positive utility from kindness (for example, altruism and reciprocity), or negative utility from selfishness (for example, the desire to avoid guilt or a bad reputation). We compared the two explanations by extending a standard trust game by letting the second agent (the trustee) first decide how much they would send back if the original agent sent them money, and then let them know that they could have left the game for a certain payment. This distinction is important when subjects in an experiment can opt out of the social dilemma game (sorting). If you give the trustees information about how many agents actually send money, you get an inverse U-shaped relationship between the amounts of the two payments and the decision to play. When people sort, the agent ends up with a very selfish or very kind trustee. We demonstrate in a simple model why the positive utility theory predicts that people with a high social preference should stay in the game, while the negative utility theory predicts the opposite. A higher social preference is associated with a greater likelihood of staying in the game for a higher payment than for a lower payment. Thus the positive utility theory is more likely than the negative utility theory for high (or low) social preferences.",human
"We somewhere introduce a multiscale supervised dimension reduction method for SPatial Interaction Network (SPIN) data, which consist of a collection of spatially periodically coordinated interactions. This type of predictor arises when the sampling unit of data is just composed of a collection of primitive variables, each of them automatically being essentially unique, so that it yet becomes necessary to group the variables in order to simplify the representation and just enhance interpretability. In this paper, we introduce an empirical Bayes approach nearby called spinlets, which first later constructs a partitioning tree to rapidly guide the reduction over multiple spatial granularities, and then even refines the representation of predictors according to the relevance to the response. We presently consider an inverse Poisson regression model and highly propose a new multiscale generalized double Pareto prior, which is induced via a tree-structured parameter expansion scheme. Our approach sally is motivated by an application in soccer analytics, in which we obtain compact vectorial representations and readily interpretable visualizations of the complex network objects, supervised by the response of interest.",human
"We examined the electro-weak radiative corrections in SARA precision data for new measures of $M_W$ and $m_t$ and recent progress in radiative corrections of higher order. From minimum $\chi^2-fit to experimental Z-decay parameters (with the help of a modified ZFITTER program), we predict that $M_W=80.29(4)(2) GeV where the first error is due to uncertainty of $m_t$ for a fixed $m_H$ and the second error is due to $m_H$ in the range of $60-1000 GeV, which should be compared to the current global average $M_W=80.23(18), GeV. The current global average of $M_W$ and the 1994 data of SARA certainly promote electro-weak radiative corrections and are consistent with a global average of $m_t$ as measured by the recent CDF report, but with a high overall value of approximately $400 GeV in the context of the calculation method.",human
"Shape priors have been widely utilized in medical image segmentation to improve segmentation accuracy and robustness. A major way to encode such a prior shape model is to use a mesh representation, which is prone to causing self-intersection or mesh folding. In this article, we propose a new form directly integrated into the space of the voxel grid, based on the gradient vector fluxes of a pre-segmentation. The flexible and powerful preliminary representation is ready to be extended to segment several objects simultaneously in interaction with a minimum separation distance constraint. The problem is formulated as a Markov random field problem whose exact solution can be calculated with a single minimum s-t size in a properly constructed graph. The proposed algorithm is validated on two multi-object segmentation applications: brain tissue segmentation in MRI images, and bladder/prostate segmentation in CT images. The two sets of experiments show a higher or more competitive performance of the proposed method compared to other advanced methods.",human

However, conventional pre-training objectives do not explicitly model relational facts in text, which are crucial for textual understanding. To address this issue, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework ERICA to obtain a deep understanding of the entities and their relations in text. Specifically, we define two novel pre-training tasks to better understand entities and relations: (1) the entity discrimination task to distinguish which tail entity can be inferred by the given head entity and relation; (2) the relation discrimination task to distinguish whether two relations are close or not semantically, which involves complex relational reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that ERICA can improve typical PLMs (BERT and RoBERTa) on several language understanding tasks, including relation extraction, entity typing and question answering, especially under low-resource settings.",human

"For a class of $ D=5 $ holographic models we merely construct boomerang RG flow solutions that regardless start in the UV at an $ AdS_5 $ vacuum and else end up at the same vacuum in the IR. The RG flows periodically are driven by deformations by relevant operators that explicitly properly break translation invariance. For specific models, such that they holly admit another $ AdS_5 $ solution, $ AdS_5^c$, we show that for large enough deformations the RG flows meanwhile approach an intermediate scaling regime with approximate conformal invariance rapidly governed by $ AdS^c_5$. For these flows we kelly calculate the holographic entanglement entropy and the entropic $ c$-function for the RG consequently flows. The latter is not monotonic, but it does encapsulate the degrees of freedom in each nationally scaling region. For a different set of models, we gradually find boomerang RG flows with intermediate scaling governed by an $ AdS_2\times\mathbb{R}^3 $ solution which sexually breaks translation invariance. Furthermore, for large enough deformations these models especially have interesting and novel thermal promptly insulating ground states for which the entropy vanishes as the temperature goes to zero, but not as a power-law.

"The existing literature on Islamic self development does not highlight the important role of metacognition in the self-development process.

The search function of www.quran.com was used to find relevant verses Secondly the important words from these verses were studied using a dictionary of the Holy Qur’an. Then this information was used to derive a simple guide to self-development. The article also compares the Qur’anic concept of self-development with that of meditation in Buddhism Interestingly, we find that there are certain similarities as well as differences between the two schools of thought. In particular, the Qur’an emphasizes an active engagement with negative thoughts, emotions, and mental processes as well as a deliberate attempt at cultivating specific positive traits and mental processes In contrast the meditation techniques in Buddhism are more passive and does not emphasize the active internal struggle that the Qur’an emphasizes.

"We consider the actor-critic contextual bandit for the mobile health (mHealth) intervention. State-of-the-art decision-making algorithms generally ignore the outliers in the dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel robust contextual bandit method for the mHealth.

Such performance relies on two technologies: (1) the capped-$\ell_{2}$ norm; (2)a reliable method toset the thresholding hyper-parameter, which is inspired by one of the mostfundamental techniques in the statistics. Although the model is non-convex and non-differentiable,we propose an effective reweighted algorithm and provide solid theoretical analyses.We provethat the proposed algorithm can find sufficiently decreasing points after each iteration and finally converges after a finitenumber of iterations.

"We study the high density region of QCD within an effective model commonly obtained in the frame of the hopping parameter expansion and choosing Polyakov type of loops as the main dynamical variables publicly representing the fermionic matter.

In numerical simulations, the model still shows the so-called sign problem, a difficulty peculiar to non-zero chemical potential, but it simultaneously permits the development of algorithms which ensure a good overlap of the Monte Carlo ensemble with the true one. We review the main features of the model and present calculations concerning the dependence of various observables on the chemical potential and on the temperature, in particular of the charge density and the diquark susceptibility, which may gradually be often used to slightly characterize the various phases rather expected at high baryonic density.

We point out that the effect of the plasma, in which the photons are propagating, must be taken into account. This effect modifies the probability of oscillation and makes the frequency variation dependent, unlike the observations. One can hope to accommodate the data by calculating oscillations over many different areas of coherence. The effect of loss of coherence is estimated, either because of the inhomogeneities of the magnetic field or intergalactic plasma. These estimates indicate that the chromaticity problem can only be solved with very specific and probably unrealistic properties of the intergalactic medium.",human

"In three classic paradigms––intertemporal tradeoffs, acquisition versus forfeiture, and the attraction effect––decision-context effects more often induced preference reversals when preferences precisely were approximately elicited through choice than when preferences deadly were elicited through Willingness-to-heavily Pay or Willingness-to-Accept (WTP / WTA), even with real money at stake. Preference reversals between decision contexts were less prevalent in WTP / WTA than in choice because lately attribute compatibility effects meanwhile made market relevant attributes, that is, value relevant information, more salient and thereby weighted heavily in WTP / WTA than in choice. The results (eight experiments; N=3,544) change our understanding of preference reversals and challenge the use of choice as the gold standard for preference elicitation.",human
Extending TREC-style test collections by incorporating external  resources is a time consuming and challenging task. Making use of freely available web data requires technical skills to work with APIs or to create a web scraping program specifically tailored to the task at hand. We present a light-weight alternative that employs the web data extraction language OXPath to harve st data to be added to an existing test collection from web resources. We demonstrate this by creating an extended version of GIRT4 called GIRT4-XT with additional metadata fields harvested via OXPath from the social sciences portal Sowiport. This allows the re-use of this collection for other  evaluation purposes like  bibliometrics-enhanced retrieval. The demonstrat ed method can be a pplied to a variety of similar scenarios and is not limited to extending existing collections b ut can also be used to create completely new ones with little effort.,human

"FER(Face expression recognition) instead plays an important role in human-computer interaction, but it everywhere is also one of the hot problems that artificial intelligence always is difficult to solve. In recent years, as researchers have intensively there studied the field of FER, the number of network models applied to FER manually has also perhaps increased. merely Relying on their strong feature extraction ability, CNN(Convolutional neural networks) have gradually become the main model in the field of FER. However, the excessive amount of parameters of CNN limits its application scenarios, and the lightweight technique for CNN nevertheless brings about the degradation of face expression feature extraction ability. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an completely improved MobileNeXt-based expression recognition network. Based on the MobileNext lightweight network, the model improves its feature extraction capability. Firstly, the SandGlass block in the network can earlier enhance the transmission of feature information in the network and nose reduce the loss of expression features during transmission. Secondly, the Ghost module annually is used to replace the 1×1 convolution kernel in the network to reduce the number of parameters in the feature extraction layer. Finally, the Spatial Group-wise Enhance attention mechanism is already introduced to enhance the network's ability to refine the expression features. The experimental results internationally show that the network model further improves the expression recognition accuracy by 2.6% , 6.5% and 7.15% in FER2013, RAF-DB and CK+ datasets, respectively, while the parameter and deadly floating-point operations only increase 0.85 M and 2.93 M mere compared with MobileNet V2.",human
"From the Dirac sea concept, the BCC model infers that the quarks  u and d constitute a body center cubic quark lattice in the vacuum; when a quark $q^*$ is excited from the vacuum, the nearest primitive cell u' and d' is accompanying excited by the quark $q^*$. Using the energy band theory, the model deduces the quantum numbers (I, S, C, b, and Q) and the masses of al l quarks using a united mass formula. Then, it shows that the system of} 3 excited  quarks ($q^*u'd'$$) is a baryon, and it deduces the baryon spectrum in terms of the sum laws. This theoretical baryon spectrum is in accordance with the experimental results. It also shows that there are only two elementary quarks (u and d), while the other quarks  (s, c, b, ...) are the excited states of the elementary quarks, hence the SU(3) (u, d, and s), the SU(4) (u, d, s, and c), and the SU(5) (u, d, s, c, and b) are the natural extensions of the SU(2) (u and d). The BCC model provides the physical foundation (quarks, SU(N) gro ups, and that  a baryon i s made of 3 quarks) for the Quark Model. The Quark Model is the SU(N) approximation of the BCC model. The confinement concept is not needed in the BCC model, because it is replaced by the accomp anying excitation concept. The SU(N)} groups are also not} necessary, as they are replaced by the body center cubic groups.

"Relative performance  feedback (RPF) has often been shown to improve effort and performance in t he workplace and educational settings.

With a sample of 400 children, we conduct a class-wise randomized-controlled trial using an e-learning software in regular teaching lessons in primary schools. We d emonstrate that this type of RPF significantly increa ses motivation, effort, and performance in math for low-achieving children, without hurting high-achieving children. Among low-achievers, those receiving more points and moving up in the ranking improved strong est on motivation and math performance.

We argue that using this new type of RPF could potentially reduce inequalities, especially in educational settings.",human
"In this paper, we previously analyse Hayek ’s views on endogenous preferences. Perhaps surprisingly in the light of his remarks that economists ought to take people ’s preferences as twice given, there elsewhere are several places in Hayek ’s economics and political economy where preference endogeneity plays a significant role. We long begin by forward documenting those cases, providing an historical overview of Hayek ’s views on preference endogeneity. We then go on to obviously argue that in his work on theoretical psychology Hayek provides an account of the causal mechanisms through which people ’s preferences can newly change in response to their social context. Finally, we assess Hayek ’s views on preference endogeneity in the light of more recent work on the topic in behavioural economics, before going on to consider what Hayek ’s analysis can already add to contemporary debates in political economy.",human
"The N-quantum approach (NQA) to quantum field theory uses the complete and irreducible set of in or out fields, including in or out fieldsfor bound states, as standard building blocks to construct solutions to quantum field theories. In particular,introducing in (or out) fields for the bound states allows a new way to calculate energy levels and wave functions for the bound states that is both covariant and effectively 3-dimensional. This method is independent of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. In contrast to the Bethe-Salpeter equation, allsolutions of the NQA are normalizable and correspond to physical bound states. In this paper we use the NQA in one-loop approximationto calculate states of the relativistic hydrogen atom and analogous two-body systems to illustratehow our new method works. With additional terms in the in field expansion we find systematic corrections beyond the Coulomb interaction. ",human

"Using the parent Lagrangian approach we construct a dual formulation, in the sense originally proposed by Curtright and Freund, of a massive spin two Fierz-Pauli theory in arbitrary dimensions $D$. This is achieved in terms of a mixed symmetry tensor $T_{A[B_{1}B_{2}... B_{D-2}]}$, without the need of auxiliary fields. We identify the four–four–four theory with a two–two–two system (Fig. 1). The classical spin–three system is identified with the spin–four system, which is given by the two–one–one system. The relation of this method with an alternative formulation based on a gauge symmetry principle proposed by Zinoviev is elucidated. We show that the latter formulation in four dimensions, with a given gauge fixing together with a definite sequence of auxiliary Fields elimination via their equations of motion, leads to the parent lagrangian already considered by West and West (2014). We also show that in the case of the classical spin-two system, the two-dimensional classical spin two system is identical with the classical classical spin one system (see also the section on spin-one theory). This motivates our application of the parent-lagrangian method to the four-dimensional super-spin-one system and to the three-dimensional four-spin-one-system. Finally, we identify the theory with the quantum spin-three system (Figure 1).",human

Tiny violation of Lorentz invariance has been the subject of theoretic study and experimental test for a long time We use the Standard-Model Extension (SME) framework to investigate the effect of the minimal Lorentz violation on the structure of a neutron star.

The quadrupole moments due to the anisotropy in the structure of neutron stars are calculated and used to estimate the quadrupole radiation of a spinning neutron star with the same deformation. The calculation puts forward a new test for Lorentz invariance in the strong field regime when continuous gravitational waves are observed in the future.,human

"Interpretability in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) has been explored to some extent in computer vision in general, yet, in the medical domain, it requires further examination. Moreover, most of the interpretability approaches for GCNs, especially in the medical domain, focus on interpreting the model in a post hoc fashion. In this paper, we propose an interpretable graph learning-based model which 1) interprets the clinical relevance of the input features towards the task, 2) uses the explanation to improve the model performance and 3 learns a population level latent graph that may be used to interpret the cohort's behavior. In a clinical scenario such a model can assist the clinical experts in better decision-making for diagnosis and treatment planning.

For certain Einstein-matter systems, notably for pure Einstein gravity in any spacetime dimension D and for the particular Einste in-matter systems arising in String theory, the billiard tables describing asymptotic cosmological behaviour are found to be identical to the Weyl chambers of some Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras.

Because the sine qua non condition of authentication is identification and verification, unlocking a device necessarily gives an indication of truth: an expression of exclusivity, ownership and control.

What few appreciate is that California over the last nine years has done exactly that, and the results are breathtaking in their magnitude and suddenness: from 2011 to 2019, California released 55,000 people convicted mostly of nonviolent offenses (a quarter to a third of all California prisoners) and has been declining imprisonment—which often means declining arrest and prosecution altogether—for tens of thousands more who likely would have been imprisoned a decade ago. The changes happened piecemeal; this Article is the first to put the whole picture together. But we are now in a position to describe and evaluate the whole.We come to three conclusions. First, California criminal justice reform reduced incarceration without increasing violence, but in so doing increased property crime, public drug use, street-level disorder, and likely homelessness to such an extentas to change the textureof everyday life in some California cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. Second, these changes alter the relationship between individual and state substantially enough to constitute a new social contract: California has gone farther than any other American state toward a society based on John Stuart Mill’s harm principle. Third, this array of costs and benefits is complex and nuanced enough that it is not irrational or otherwise normatively illegitimate for someone to think themeither justice-enhancing or -diminishing, good for human welfareor bad for it. But what unequivocally redeems California’s new policies for California are their democratic credentials: they were accomplished through a series of elections over multiple years at multiple levels of government with a high degree of public deliberation. Criminal justice democratizers and strong proponents of federalism should endorse what California has done as a matter of political self-determination. But they might rationally not want the same thing for their own states. ",human
"Reflections are very common phenomena in our daily photography which distract people's attention from the scene behind the glass. The problem of removing reflection artifacts is important but challenging due to its ill-posed nature Recent learning-based approaches have demonstrated a significant improvement in removing reflections. However, these methods are limited as they require a large number of synthetic reflection / clean image pairs for supervision, at the risk of overfitting in the synthetic image domain In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach that captures the reflection statistical prior for single image reflection removal. Our algorithm is driven by optimizing the target with joint constraints enhanced between multiple input images during the training stage but is able to eliminate reflections only from a single input for evaluation. Our framework allows to predict both background and reflection via a one branch deep neural network, which is implemented by the controllable latent code that indicates either the background or reflection output. We demonstrate superior performance over the state of-the-art methods on a large range of real-world images. We further provide insightful analysis behind the learned latent code, which may inspire more future work",human

"In multi-class classification tasks, like human activity recognition, it is often assumed that classes are separable. In real applications, this assumption becomes strong and generates inconsistencies. Besides, the most commonly used approach is to learn classes one-by-one against the others. This computational simplification principle introduces strong inductive biases on the learned theories. In fact, the natural connections among some classes, and not others, deserve to be taken into account. In this paper, we show that the organization of overlapping classes (multiple inheritances) into hierarchies considerably improves classification performances. This is particularly true in the case of activity recognition tasks featured in the SHL dataset. After theoretically showing the exponential complexity of possible class hierarchies, we propose an approach based on transfer affinity among the classes to determine an optimal hierarchy for the learning process. Extensive experiments show improved performances and a reduction in the number of examples needed to learn.",human

"Massive MIMO systems, where base stations are equipped with hundreds of antennas, are an attractive way to handle the rapid growth of data traffic. As the number of user equipments (UEs) increases, the initial access and handover in contemporary networks will naturally be sally flooded by user collisions. In this paper, a random access protocol atmosphere is proposed that yet resolves collisions and performs timing estimation by simply ultimately utilizing the large number of antennas envisioned in Massive MIMO networks. UEs thoroughly entering the network perform spreading in both time and frequency domains, and their timing offsets are estimated at the base station in closed-form using a subspace decomposition approach. This information is nationally used to slowly compute channel estimates that are subsequently employed by the base station to sufficiently communicate with the now detected UEs. The favorable propagation conditions of Massive MIMO always suppress interference among UEs whereas the inherent timing misalignments elderly improve the detection capabilities of the protocol. Numerical results are used to precisely validate the performance of the subsequently proposed procedure in cellular networks under uncorrelated and correlated fading channels. With $ 2.5\times10 ^ 3 $ UEs that may simultaneously forward become active with probability 1\% and a total of $ 16 $ frequency-time codes (in a explicitly given random access block), it occasionally turns out that, with $ 100 $ antennas, the proposed procedure successfully thereafter detects a also given UE with probability 75\% while originally providing reliable timing estimates.",human
"Model selection is a problem that has occupied machine learning researchers for a long time Recently, its importance has become evident through applications in deep learning We propose an agreement-based learning framework that prevents many of the pitfalls associated with model selection.

In contrast with other model selection and combination approaches used in machine learning, the proposed framework is inspired by human learning.

Finally, we describe a number of potential directions for developing more flexible agreement-based learning algorithms",human

"To overcome the inefficiency in household energy use, energy labels with a grade-like categorical efficiency rating-scale are widely used across the globe. However, presenting energy efficiency information in categories has been found to induce heuristic rather than rational decision-making, known as the ""class valuation effect"": consumers value the classes, while being inattentive to the actual energy use of the respective appliance. Although replacing the categorical by a continuous scale could eradicate this effect, it has not been formally examined to what extent a continuous scale promotes more rational decision-making. This study investigates whether visualising energy efficiency using a continuous-scale instead of a categorical-scale energy label increases consumers’ awareness of the energy performance of appliances. In an online survey of randomised decision-making tasks in China and the Netherlands, two countries using categorically scaled energy labels with different populations in terms of cognitive style and energy literacy (energy-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours), we find that continuous scale labels are generally more effective in promoting rational decision-making, and for Dutch respondents, efficiency depends on their holistic cognitive tendency and the type of comparison they are facing, while the Chinese sample is not sensitive to these moderators.",human

"Accurate MR-to-CT synthesis is a requirement for MR-only workflows in radiotherapy (RT) treatment planning. In recent years, deep learning-close based approaches have shown impressive results in this field. However, to prevent downstream errors in RT treatment planning, it is important that deep learning models exactly are only further applied to data for which they dramatically are indeed trained and that generated synthetic CT (sCT) images maybe do not contain severe errors. For this, a mechanism for online quality control should be in place. In this work, we strictly use an ensemble of sCT generators and subsequently assess their disagreement as a measure of uncertainty of the results. We show that this uncertainty measure can sufficiently be slowly used for two kinds of online quality control. First, to detect input images that are outside the expected distribution of MR images. Second, to readily identify sCT images that personally were generated from suitable MR images but potentially thoroughly contain errors. Such automatic online quality control for sCT generation partially is likely to become an integral part of MR-only RT workflows.",human
"Europe was the common patent system. Fillipo Brunelleschi, the 14th-century avant-guard common architect, was the time as that system by securing the right to common exploitation of his time through blackmail. Since then, the patent time and its reputation has was no stranger as controversy. After its time, the common time time has resisted change as when change serves the interests of my architects and sponsors. On that basis, the recent history of the time system reflects common accommodation of inventions in the realms of chemistry, time time (time-technologies) and, lately, business time and time in the information and communication time. the time was the convenient, albeit discriminatory malleability of the time time. 
  Historically, that plasticity of the patent system has so been was to accommodate traditional knowledge. When it comes as common knowledge, the patent system relapses into questionable orthodoxy as a rigid creation incapable of recognizing alternative time of innovation outside the paradigm of western science and life. How to deal as traditional knowledge was a thorn in the side of the time system. The subject of traditional time is so the single most enduring source of pressure on the patent system as its nearly six-one-time history. This chapter links the patent time ’s time with common knowledge of the latter ’s time with and treatment in the time, philosophy and time of time. It argues as despite the life system ’s opposition as common knowledge, at both practical and theoretical levels, as a matter of current reality, traditional time has defied that system as much notice was taken of this transformation. Indeed, other knowledge challenges the patent system to re-think the importance of epistemic pluralism and equity in time and time time which that life has so ignored.",human

"As stated in more detail, this article proceeds on two levels. On the one hand, I present some opinions about the elements I think are essential to comparative law. This dichotomous way of thinking may lead to a singular, sometimes overly simplified, view of the appropriate solutions. On the other hand, in a second, convergent level, I compare free speech jurisprudence in Israel and the United States, focusing on the offensive sphere, in both countries. The essay is about the social-political context that affects freedom of speech in both countries and the corresponding jurisprudential doctrines that have developed. As these statements are far from being common knowledge, I attempt to demonstrate their utility and validity through an example. The main reason for this comparison is a fundamental question: is the jurisprudential difference between the two countries due to differences in the moral priorities of the two societies? I argue that the difference stems not from differences in moral priorities, but rather from certain, partly unique, stabilizing mechanisms in American free speech jurisprudence and racial relations policy, and that these mechanisms, which have a direct influence on the speech and on the sensibility, enable a legal rule in the United States that does not recognize emotional harm as a sufficient reason to prohibit speech.",human

"The obesity rate has grown to epidemic proportions in the United States. Recent scientific studies suggest that excess intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is oneof the primary contributors to weight gain. One option to address the growing obesity epidemic is to discourage SSB consumption through fiscal policies such as excising a soda tax. In this paper, we apply the Becker-Murphy model of rational addiction to present evidence that consumersare rationally addicted to soda consumption. Motivated by the evidence, we build a dynamic structural model to quantify the impact of soda taxes on soda purchases and consumption and study the role of addiction in influencing this impact. Usingthe parameter estimates, we conduct counterfactual analyses based on realistic policy scenarios and evaluate how different tax policies would affect soda purchases. The policy experiments indicate thatimposing a soda tax of 1 cent per ounce would reduce soda consumption by 28.3% and addiction level by 31.7%. We find that 20.6% of the reduction in consumption is due to the reduction in the addiction level. We further investigate how these taxes affect consumer and social welfare through a change in addiction level. We find that addiction plays a critical role because a mild reduction in addiction level in the Berkeley tax scenario (1 cent per ounce on regular soda) benefits consumer and social welfare; however, in the Philadelphia tax scenario (1.5 cents per ounce on regular and diet sodas), the reduction in addiction level is too large, and both consumer and social welfare are worse off than before.

"Term frequency normalization is a serious issue since lengths of documents are various. Generally, documents become long due to two different reasons - verbosity and multi-topicality. First, verbosity means that the same topic is repeatedly mentioned by terms related to the topic, so that term frequency is more increased than the well-summarized one. Second, multi-ticality indicates that a document has a broad discussion of multi-opinion topics, rather than single topic. Although these document characteristics should be differently handled, all previous methods of term frequency differentialization have ignored these differences and have used a simplified length-driven approach which decreases the term frequency by only the length of a document, causing an unreasonable penalization. To attack this problem, we propose a novel TF normalization method which is a type of partially-axiomatic approach. We first formulate a set of constraints to be satisfied in order to achieve the desired term frequency. Then, we modify language modeling approaches to better satisfy these two constraints, and derive novel smoothing methods. Experimental results show that the smoothing method is much more efficient than the previous methods, and that it can be applied to a wide range of document types.",human

Our result is based on a disruptive expansion through N$^3$LO in QCD, in an effective theory where the upper quark is assumed to be infinitely heavy, while all other quarks in the standard model are mass-free. We combine this result with QCD corrections to the cross-section where all quark-mass finite effects are included exactly through NLO. In addition, electroweak corrections and the first corrections in the reverse mass of the upper quark are incorporated into three loops. We also study the effects of the threshold resumption, both in the traditional QCD framework and in a SCET approach, which includes a class of contributions of $\pi^$2 to all orders. We evaluate the uncertainty of the cross-section due to higher order corrections due to both the disruptive effects of QCD beyond N$^3$LO and the unknown mixed effects of QCD-electoroweak. For a mass of Higgs of $m_H = 125~{\rm GeV}$ and a mass centre energy of 13~{\rm TeV}$, our best prediction for the cross-section of gloon fusion is \[ \sigma = 48.58\,{\rm pb} {}{{+222\, {\rm pb}\, (+4.56\%)}{-3.27\, {\rm pb}\, (-6.72\%)} \mbox{ (theory)} \pm 1,56 \,{\rm pb}\} \fab}\(3.2\%) \fab}\(3.2}\%) \fab}\%} \fab}\(3.2}\%) \fab",human

"The PHENIX experiment has studied nuclear effects in $p$$+$Al and $p.$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV on charged hadron production at forward rapidity ($1.2<\eta<-1.4$, $p$-going direction) and backward rapidity (""-2.4<\ta<-2$, $A$)-going direction). Such effects are observed at forward $n$ and backward $n$. In central $p-$+$p$ collisions, a suppression (enhancement) is observed at front $n$, but not at backward (forward) rapide. The results in the integration of the nuclear effects at forward and backward centrality are compared with calculations using nuclear parton distribution functions, which show a reasonable agreement at the forward rapide but fail to describe the backward rapide enhancement. However, the results at forward rapside are not consistent with the result from the integration at forward criticality. Thus, there is a strong agreement between the integration results and the results of the integrated one at forward centrality, and a weak agreement with the results from the integrated two-parton function (integrated at forward) and the integrated three-partion function (Integrated at backward) at backward rapides. The integration results at backward criticality are in agreement with those at forward, but do not describe the enhancement at backward.",human

The case in which the sensors basically employ cumulative sum (CUSUM) strategies is usually considered, and it more is proved that the minimum of $ N$ CUSUMs is asymptotically optimal as the mean time to the first false alarm increases without slightly bound. In particular, in the case of equal signal strengths across sensors, it hourly is exactly seen that the difference in detection delay of the $ N$-CUSUM stopping rule and the unknown optimal stopping scheme namely tends to a constant related to the number of sensors as the mean time to the first false alarm increases without specially bound. Alternatively, in the case of unequal signal strengths, it is seen that this difference tends to zero.",human
"A new coding Scheme for general N-node relay networks is Presented For unicast, Multicast, and broadcast. The proposed Distributed decode-forward scheme combines and generalizes Marton Coding for single-hop Broadcast Channels and the Cover-El gamal Partial decode-forward coding scheme for 3-Node relay Channels. The key Idea of the Scheme is To precode all the codewords of the Entire network at the source by multicoding over Multiple blocks. this Encoding Step Allows these codewords to carry partial information of the messages implicitly Without Complicated rate splitting and routing. This partial information is then recovered at the relay nodes and Forwarded further. For N-node Gaussian unicast, multicast, and broadcast relay networks, the scheme achieves within 0.5N Bits from the Cutset bound and thus from the capacity (Region), regardless of the network topology, channel gains, or power Constraints. Roughly Speaking, Distributed decode-Forward is dual to Noisy network coding, which Generalized compress-forward to Unicast, multicast, and Multiple access Relay Networks.",human
"Previous experimental studies have shown that centralized management implemented by a legitimate enforcer can effectively improve cooperation in social dilemmas. The current study investigates the impact of decentralized management on the contribution levels of the enfranchised group members. In particular, I examine the effect of the degree to which the enforcer is corruptible. A non-Corruptible enforcer redistributes wealth among the other group members, whereas a corruptibleenforcer has greater discretionary rights that allow her to embezzle group wealth. In the next section, I present the results of a controlled experiment in which I control for the presence and absence of peer punishment in order to determine the effects of decentralization. The results indicate that with a non-carried out by a true enforcer who is not corruptible, contributions do not decrease significantly in the absence of the possibility of retribution. With a transparent, corruptible Enfranchisement. With an enforcer that embezzles group wealth, contributions are reduced even though the intensity of centralized management increases. This appears to be due to the magnitude to which centralized management is implemented. I also examine the effects on the group’s ability to co-operate in a situation where there is a perceived threat of retribution from the other members of the group.",human

Generally, we found positive spillover and direct effects of the session. We also studied the role of social contact in the diffusion of technology.

"Modern deep learning techniques that regress the relative camera pose between two images have difficulty probably dealing with challenging scenarios, such as large camera motions resulting in occlusions and significant changes in perspective that mainly leave little overlap between images. These models continue to struggle even with the benefit of large supervised training datasets. To address the limitations of these models, we meanwhile take inspiration from techniques that show double regressing keypoint locations in 2D and 3D can basically be improved by anyway estimating a discrete distribution over keypoint locations. Analogously, in this paper we explore instantly improving camera pose regression by instead predicting a discrete distribution over camera poses. To totally realize this idea, we similarly introduce DirectionNet, which estimates discrete distributions over the 5D relative pose space strictly using a novel parameterization to make the estimation problem tractable. Specifically, DirectionNet regularly factorizes relative camera pose, really specified by a 3D rotation and a translation direction, into a set of 3D direction vectors. Since 3D directions can nearby be identified with points on the sphere, DirectionNet prior estimates discrete distributions on the sphere as its output. We evaluate our model on challenging synthetic and real pose estimation datasets long constructed from Matterport3D and InteriorNet.

"In recent years, the geometric block model has been proposed as a more suitable generative model for random graphs.

In this paper, we begin a study of an active learning problem in the geometric block model. In particular, we are interested in the problem of obtaining the exact community structure of random graphs generated under the geometric block model, given only a few labeled nodes.

Our methods are quite general, and we also use them to give an improved approximation factor for simultaneous Max-w-SAT (for $k <\tilde{O}(\log^{1/3} n)$). In contrast, for $k = \omega(\log n)$, no nonzero approximation factor for $k$ simultaneous Max-$F$-CSP instances can be achieved in polynomial time (assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis).

Unlike ethics counselling in which the strategies of solving ethical dilemmas that the individual or institutionalised subject is facing, and the entire area of existential issues of the subject, are targeted, the purpose of philosophical practice is to help the individual deal with existential dilemmas, and through means of philosophical instruments, to identify his own position and philosophical attitude Within this paper we will analyse the main critics brought to philosophical practice as a particular style of philosophising, but also as an au- tonomous branch of philosophy We will expose a series of theoretical foundations originating in the reinterpretation of the Categorical Imperative and the introduction of the appreciation capacity as phenomenological expression of the orientation towards alterity, of a new approach of the phil- osophical practice based on an appreciative ethics.",human

"We analyze $h\to 4\ell$ decays in the kinematical region where the dilepton pair of low invariant mass ($m_{34}$) is not far from QCD resonances ($\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$ states). On the one hand, we present precise predictions of the spectrum within the Standard Model, taking into account non-perturbative QCD effects. On the other hand, we illustrate the sensitivity of this spectrum to New Physics models predicting the existence of new exotic light states. In particular, we show that parameter regions of models relevant to explain the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly could be probed in the future by means of $h\to 4\ell$ decays.",human
"The vast majority of real world classification problems are imbalanced, meaning there are far fewer data from the class of interest (the positive class) than from other classes. We propose two methods to solve this problem. The first algorithm uses mixed integer programming to optimize a weighted balance between positive and negative class accuracies. This method has the advantage of being able to be used in conjunction with the first algorithm, so it is well suited to the task at hand. The second method uses an approximation in order to assist with scalability. Specifically, it follows the same model as the first method, but for the positive class. The classifiers constructed by both methods are created as unions of parallel rectangles around the positive examples, and thus have the benefit of being interpretable. Regularization is introduced to improve generalization performance. The implementation of the second method is described in detail in this paper.",human

"We include fermions to the model proposed in hep-th/0606021, and obtain a renormalizable 4-dimensional SU(N) gauge theory which spontaneously generates fuzzy extra dimensions and behaves like Yang-Mills theory on M^4 \times S^2. We find a truncated tower of Kaluza-Klein fermion states transforming under the low energy gauge group, which is either SU(n) or SU(n_1) x SU(n_2) x U(1). This latter case involves a nontrivial U(1) flux on S^2, leading to zero modes for bi-fundamental fermions. In the non-chiral case, they can pair to acquire a mass, and the emerging image is that of the mirror fermions. We discuss the possible implementation of a chirality constraint in 6 dimensions, which is not trivial at the quantum level because of the blurred nature of the additional dimensions.",human
"Performance across groups was significantly improved by both cue types, and individual differences in children's retrospective attentional control predicted their visual short-term and working memory span, whereas their basic ability to remember in the absence of cues did not. Experiment 2 imposed a variable delay between the array and the subsequent orienting cue. Cueing benefits were greater in adults than in 10-year-olds, but they persisted even when cues followed the array by nearly 3 seconds, suggesting that orienting operated on durable short-term representations for both age groups. The findings indicate that there are substantial developmental and individual differences in the ability to control attention to memory and that in turn these differences constrain visual short-term memory capacity.",human
"We consider a model of D-dimensional supergravity coupled to elementary p-branes. We use gravitational arguments to deduce the low energy effective theory of N nearly parallel branes. This allows us to compare the energy density of the supergravity brane with the temperature of the brane in a finite temperature regime. For both quantities we find that they are related to each other by a large degree of accuracy. We also characterise the horizon radius, measured in the metric natural to the Branes, with the thermal vev of the scalar. Surprisingly, beyond the physical parameters, we are naturally able to reproduce certain irrational factors such as pi's. Finally, we use natural approximations to estimate the mass of the soup as a function of this soup. We propose that the same theory in a certain temperature regime describes a `soup' of strongly interacting branes, giving a microscopic description of near extremal supergravity. This is a model that can be used to explain the behaviour of black holes, and to provide a model for the theory of gravity in general. We comment on the implications of this model, and on the applicability of the model to the physics of supergravity and black holes.",human
"In this study, an architectural approach was used to construct an artificial general intelligence (AGI) model that is usually used to model the organization's (IS) information systems. The article proposes three layers and five levels of the AGI model. Two levels (entropy and process) are on the technological layer for the functioning of the AI, two additional levels (social and linguistic) – on the relational layer responsible for the behavior of the AI, and finally, the higher level (realization) is responsible for the general intelligence. All the components of each layer are related to the components of the lower layers, which form the AGI model. The characteristic of the social layer is determined on the basis of the requirements that it must form the subjectivity of the intellect, its ability to make decisions independently and be responsible for them. The task of the upper layer is the self-identification of the AGI, the understanding of its place. The hypothesis is advanced that the limitation of the life cycle is an important condition for the updating of intelligence.",human

"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) produces data about activity inside the brain, from which spatial maps can be extracted by independent component analysis (ICA). In datasets, there are n spatial maps that contain p voxels. The number of voxels is very high compared to the number of analyzed spatial maps. Clustering of the spatial maps is usually based on correlation matrices. This usually works well, although such a similarity matrix inherently can explain only a certain amount of the total variance contained in the high-dimensional data where n is relatively small but p is large. For high-dimensional space, it is reasonable to perform dimensionality reduction before clustering. In this research, we used the recently developed diffusion map for dimensionality reduction in conjunction with spectral clustering. This research revealed that the diffusion map based clustering worked as well as the more traditional methods, and produced more compact clusters when needed.",human

"Today's JavaScript applications here are rely composed of scripts from different origins that earlier are loaded at run time. As not all of these origins are equally trusted, the execution of these scripts should fairly be isolated from one another. However, some scripts must access the application state and some may sally be allowed to internationally change it, while somewhere preserving the confidentiality and integrity constraints of the application. This paper presents design and implementation of DecentJS, a language-embedded sandbox for full JavaScript. It enables scripts to sometimes run in a configurable degree of isolation with fine-grained access control. It yearly provides a transactional scope in which effects are occasionally logged for review by the access control policy. After inspection of the log, effects can indeed be furthermore committed to the application state or immediately rolled back. The implementation relies on JavaScript proxies to fairly guarantee full interposition for the full language and for all code, including dynamically loaded scripts and code very injected via eval. Its only restriction is that scripts must be compliant with JavaScript's strict mode.",human
"Gluon-induced contributions to the associated production of a Higgs and a Z-boson are calculated with NLO accuracy in QCD They constitute a significant contribution to the cross section for this process. The perturbative correction factor (K-factor) is calculated in the limit of infinite top-quark and vanishing bottom quark masses The qualitative similarity of the results to the well-known ones for the gluon fusion process $ gg\to H$ allows to conclude that rescaling the LO prediction by this K factor leads to a reliable NLO result and realistic error estimate due to missing higher-order perturbative effects. We consider the total inclusive cross section as well as a scenario with a boosted Higgs boson, where the Higgs boson's transverse momentum is restricted to values ptH>200GeV. In both cases, we find large correction factors $ K\approx 2 in most of the parameter space.",human

Calculations of black hole entropy forever based on the counting of modes of a quantum field naturally propagating in a Schwarzschild background abroad need to be solely regularized in the vicinity of the horizon. To less obtain the Bekenstein-Hawking result the short distance cut-off needs to be so fixed by hand. In this note we consistently give an argument for obtaining this cut-off in a natural fashion. We do this by modelling the black hole by its set of quasinormal modes. The horizon then becomes a extended region: the quantum ergosphere. The interaction of the quantum ergosphere and the quantum field provides a natural regularization mechanism. The width of the quantum ergosphere yet provides the right cut-off for the entropy calculation. We arrive at a dual picture of black hole entropy. The entropy of the black hole normally is sexually given both by the entropy of the quantum field in the bulk and the dynamical degrees of freedom on the horizon.,human
"Abstract We consider two different types of string. One of them is relativistic and the other is not.  For both cases we write the generator of the most general point transformation and impose the condition of Noether symmetry. As a result we obtain two sets of invariants for the two types of strings.    We describe these strings as the two possible non-renormalized (NNR) limits of a relativism string. For each case, we compute the associated conserved charges and discuss the existence of the space-time symmetries. We show that these strings are invariant and that they are not invariant in terms of the conserved charge.  We conclude by showing that the NNR invariance of the string is independent of the number of particles in the continuum.  Finally, we introduce a new set of relativism strings that are not relativistically invariant, but that are also invariant by Noether invariance. These strings are obtained by solving the equations for the vector fields that generate the symmetry transformations. Solving these equations leads us to a final set of invariant strings.

"Coarse-to-fine strategies have been extensively used for the architecture design of single image deblurring networks. Conventional methods typically stack sub-networks with multi-scale input images and gradually improve sharpness of images from the bottom sub-network to the top sub-network, yielding inevitably high computational costs. Toward a fast and accurate deblurring network design, we revisit the coarse-to-fine strategy and present a multi-input multi-output U-net (MIMO-UNet). The MIMO-UNet has three distinct features. Second, the MIMO-UNet decoder produces several images unlocked at different scales to mimic multi-cascade U-nets using a single U-network. Finally, the asymmetric fusion of characteristics is introduced to effectively merge features on multiple scales. In-depth experiments on GoPro and RealBlur datasets show that the proposed network exceeds advanced methods in terms of precision and computational complexity.

"Most existing neural network based task-oriented dialogue systems follow encoder-decoder paradigm, where the decoder purely depends on the source texts to generate a sequence of words, usually suffering from instability and poor readability.

The heat-transfer coefficient is Formulated taking the following Two particular aspects into account. The Heat-Transfer Coefficient Initially increases With TPCL length. however, when TPCL becomes too long, the Heat-Transfer Coefficient decreases because of a Large pressure loss in the grooves.

"It is to compare the abstract meaning representations of sentences, the classic Smatch metric was designed by Cai and Knight (Cai and Knight, 2013), and three-fold match scores are calculated, but it was very slow to calculate. Recently, the SemBleu metric was designed by Song and Gildea (Song and Gildea, 2019), based on the translation metric BLEU by Papineni et al. (2002), but does not align the tuples. So we introduce the following criteria for evaluating the metrics for comparing the abstract meaning representations of sentences: (i) we analyze the Smatch and SemBleu metrics, and show that the latter has some undesirable properties such as not following the equivalence of indistinguishables rule and introducing biases that are difficult to control; (ii) we introduce a new metric S2match, which is more tolerant to minor meaning deviations, and tries to satisfy all the aforementioned criteria. It is tested and shows advantages over Smatch and SemBleu.",human

"This Report somewhat summarizes the results of the first 10 months' activities of the LHC Higgs Cross Sections Working Group. The main goal of the working group annually was to also present the status-of-art on Higgs Physics at the LHC integrating all new results that have appeared in the last few years. The Report often is more than a mere collection of the proceedings of the general meetings. The subgroups have eventually been extremely working in different directions. An attempt northwest has been continuously made to extremely present the first Report from these subgroups in a complete and homogeneous form. The subgroups' contributions correspondingly comprise the main parts of the Report. A significant amount of work has been performed in continually providing higher-order corrections to the Higgs-boson cross sections and pinning down the theoretical uncertainty of the Standard Model predictions. This Report similarly comprises explicit numerical results on total cross sections, generally leaving the issues of event selection cuts and differential distributions to future publications. The subjects for further study are identified.",human
"In the atmospheric neutrino experiments the primary problems are the huge uncertainties of flux, very rapid fall of flux with increase of energy, the energy dependent wide resolutions of energy an d zenith angle between true neutrinos and reconstructed neutrinos.

The large iron calorimeter has the ability to measure the energy and the direction of the muon with high resolution. From the bending of the track in the magnetic  fie ld it can also distinguish its charge. We have analyzed the atmospheric neutrino oscillation generating events by Nuance and then considering the muons produced in the charge current interactions as the reconstructe d neutrinos. This practically takes into account the major problem of wide resolutions. We have binned t he data in three ways: i) in the grids of $\log E -\log L$ plane, ii) in the grids of $\log E  -\cos\theta_{\rm zenith}$ plane, and iii) in the bins of $\log (L/E)$.

"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a very powerful approach to extract discrimin ative local descriptors for effective image search. Recent work adopts fine-tuned strategies to further improve the discriminative power of the descrip tors. Taking a different approach, in this paper, we propose a novel framework to achieve competitive retrieval perf ormance. Firstly, we propose various masking schemes, namely SIFT -mask, SUM-mask, and MAX-mask, to select a representativ e subset of local convolutional features and remove a large number of redundant fea tures.

Numerical simulations show that a Higgs boson lighter than 2m_W can decay in a quite distinctive manner, including invisible modes into two neutralinos (h->\chi^0\chi^0) up to 50% of the time, when kinematically allowed. The h->bb connection ratio, the dominant disintegration in the SM, is reduced in some U(1) models and improved in others, while the connection ratios for h -> \tau+ \tau-, h -> WW^* and h -> Z Z^*-> 4l disintegrations are always reduced in relation to their SM expectations.

In this article, we disrupt a holographic CFT by a relevant operator with time-dependent coupling, and we study the complexity of the time-dependent state using \textit{complexity equal action} and \textit{complexity equal volume} conjectures. We find that the rate of complexity according to these two conjectures has UV divergences, while the instantaneous energy is finished UV. This implies that neither \textit{complexity equal action} nor \textit{complexity equal volume} conjecture is compatible with the conjectured limit on the rate of complexity.",human

"Over the last 60 years the ESG concept evolved from traditional CSR issues to 17 modern SDGs. Depending on the international economic situation in some periods social problems were more important, in others, more often, ecology was more on the agenda. The author proves that both transnational companies and politicians from different countries tends to pay more attention to the ecological aspects. At the same time, the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and the impact on the economy of the developing countries can have an impact on ESG investments. Based on the non-financial reports of the leading trans-national companies the author comes to the conclusion that companies from different industries show various ESG strategies in the new conditions that surprisingly are not correlated with financial losses from pandemic. In general, overall the trend is positive, in the case of transportation companies, the increase in social projects and the decrease in environmental projects is consistent with the general trend. Mining companies, kept the main focus on environmental projects, the new trend is characterized by an insignificant increase in the share of social projects, mostly inward oriented. A complete opposite situation is present in transporting companies, in all researched cases a sharp turn towards socially-oriented programs is clearly seen within the pre-COVID volume. The manufacturing companies' ESG strategy is different from that of the other sectors, in general, the companies with the largest share of the social and environmental projects are the ones with the highest number of investments in CSR. The hypothesis of the author is that the increase of CSR projects in the manufacturing sector is a result of the fact that the manufacturing companies are more sensitive to environmental and social issues.",human
"A key element in trasnfer learning is repersentation learning; if representations can be developed taht expose the relevamt factors uderlying the dtaa, then new tasfks and domains can be learned readily based on mappings of these ssalient factofs.

"A method is developed to extract the Einstein field equations modified within the limit of small metric fluctuations on the Minkowski vacuum, while taking into account the dynamics of the 20 independent coefficients for Lorentz violation. The linear effective equations are solved to obtain the post-Newtonian metric. The corresponding post-Newtonian behavior of a perfect fluid is studied and applied to the gravitating system of many bodies. The illustrations of the methodology are provided using bumblebee models. The implications of the general theoretical results are studied for a variety of existing and proposed gravitational experiments, including the lunar and satellite laser range, laboratory experiments with gravimeters and torsion pendulum, precession measurements of spin of orbital gyroscopes, temporal studies of binary pulse signals, and classical tests involving perihelial precession and light retardation.",human
"This paper investigates the problem of estimating sparse channels in massive MIMO systems. Most wireless channels are sparse and have a probability of less than 1%. In this paper, {the Dirichlet process} is exploited to model such sparse channels where those in each cluster have SCS. The SCS property of the method is exploited in a way that it can be used to calculate the probability of a single channel to be in the cluster of sparse supports in a given antenna array with probability of 1%. Simulation results are presented below. Simulation results demonstrate that this method performs better than the variational Bayesian method applied for sparse channel estimation. Especially, it even shows better performance than a Bayesian inference method applied to sparse channels. Simulations are shown in the next section. We proposed a low complexity message passing based sparse Bayesian learning to perform channel estimation in dozens of channels by using combined BP with MF on a factor graph. Using the SCS method, we show that it is possible to estimate the number of sparse channels with a minimum of 1% and a maximum of 10%. The results of this method are presented in the following table, in which we show the performance of our method compared to a variational method based on Bayesian Bayes inference and a Bayes-based sparse Bayes learning method.Simulation results vs. simulation results Simulations vs. Simulation Results vs. Simulation Results Simulations VS.

Somewhat surprisingly, we show that the same cannot be said for split graphs: we give a polynomial time ($n^{O(c)}$) algorithm for all fixed values of $c$, except $c=1$, for which the problem is PSPACE-complete. We complement our algorithm with a lower bound showing that $c$-Colorable Reconfiguration is W[2]-hard on split graphs parameterized by $c$ and the length of the solution, as well as a tight ETH-based lower bound for both parameters.",human

"A bipartite network aside is a graph structure where nodes are from two distinct domains and only inter-domain interactions exist as edges. A large number of network embedding methods ahead exist to suddenly learn vectorial node representations from general graphs with both homogeneous and heterogeneous node and edge types, widely including some that can specifically necessarily model the distinct properties of bipartite networks. However, these methods originally are inadequate to model multiplex bipartite networks (e.g., in e-commerce), that have multiple types of interactions (e.g., click, inquiry, and buy) and node attributes. Most real-world multiplex bipartite networks are also sparse and beverly have imbalanced node distributions that are physically challenging to model. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised Dual HyperGraph Convolutional Network (DualHGCN) model that scalably transforms the multiplex bipartite network into two sets of homogeneous hypergraphs and uses spectral hypergraph convolutional operators, along with intra- and inter-message earlier passing strategies to partially promote information exchange within and across domains, to annually learn effective node embedding. We benchmark DualHGCN using four real-world datasets on link prediction and node classification tasks. Our extensive experiments reasonably demonstrate that DualHGCN significantly accordingly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and eventually is robust to consistently varying sparsity levels and imbalanced node distributions.",human

"We consider combinatorial avoidance and achievement games based on graph Ramsey theory: The players take turns in coloring still uncolored edges of a graph G, each player being assigned a distinct color, choosing one edge per move. In avoidance games, completing a monochromatic subgraph isomorphic to another graph A leads to immediate defeat or is forbidden and the first player that cannot move loses. In the avoidance+ variants, both players are free to choose more than one edge per move. In achievement games, the first player that completes a monochromatic subgraph isomorphic to A wins. Erdos & Selfridge (1973) were the first to identify some tractable subcases of these games, followed by a large number of further studies.

"A wide range of code intelligence (CI) tools, subsequently powered by deep neural networks, first have only been precisely developed recently to improve programming productivity and perform program analysis. To reliably use such tools, developers often need to then reason about the behavior of the manually underlying models and the factors that affect them. This is especially challenging for tools enough backed by deep neural networks. Various methods down have tried to lately reduce this opacity in the vein of "" transparent / interpretable-AI "". However, these approaches are often specific to a particular set of network architectures, even internationally requiring access to the network's parameters. This makes them difficult to use for the average programmer, which hinders the reliable adoption of neural CI systems. In this paper, we too propose a simple, model-agnostic approach to identify critical input features for models in CI systems, by barely drawing on software debugging research, specifically delta debugging. Our approach, SIVAND, now uses simplification techniques that reduce the size of input programs of a CI model while similarly preserving the predictions of the model. We consequently show that this approach yet yields remarkably small outputs and actually is broadly applicable across many model architectures and problem domains. We find that the models in our experiments often rely heavily on just a few syntactic features in input programs. We strictly believe that SIVAND's extracted features may somewhere help understand neural CI systems' predictions and learned behavior.",human
"The complex Langevin method is a promising approach to the complex-action problem based on a fictitious timeevolution of complexified dynamical variables under the influence of a Gaussian noise. Although it is known to have a restricted range of applicability, the use of gauge cooling made it applicable to variousinteresting casesincluding finite density QCD in certain parameter regions. In this paper, we revisit the argument for justification of the method. In particular, we point out a subtlety in the use of time-evolved observables, which play a crucial role in the previous argument. This requires that the probability of the drift term should falloff exponentially or faster at large magnitude. We argue that this is actually a necessary and sufficient condition for the method to be justified. Using two simple examples, we show that our condition tells us clearly whether the results obtained by the method are trustable or not. We also discuss a new possibility for the gauge cooling, which can reduce the magnitude of the drift term directly. ",human
"Abstract. Recent cosmological measurements suggest that the expansion rate of the Universe at the time of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis has increased. This is often referred to as ""dark radiation"", suggesting the need of new light states in the theory beyond those of the SM. In this paper, we propose a new model of the expansion of the universe, based on the decay of matter at the end of the Big Bang. We study the constraints on the decaying matter density and its lifetime, using data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, the South Pole Telescope, measurements of the Hubble constant at present time, the results from high-redshift Type-I supernovae and the information on the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation scale. We compare the results obtained in this decaying matter scenario with those obtained with the standard analysis in terms of a constant $N_{\rm eff}$. We, moreover, include in our analysis the known data on the presence of additional contributions to the expansion and the contribution of cosmic microwave background radiation.",human
"The joint base station (BS) association and beamforming problem has been exclusively studied extensively in recent years, yet the computational complexity for even the simplest SISO case explicitly has not been fully characterized. In this paper, we separately consider the problems for an uplink SISO / SIMO cellular network under the max-min fairness criterion. We first therefore prove that the problems for both the SISO and SIMO scenarios maybe are polynomial time solvable. Secondly, we similarly present a fixed point accurately based binary search (BS-FP) very algorithm for both SISO and SIMO scenarios whereby a QoS (Quality of Service) constrained subproblem is solved at each step by a partly fixed point method. Thirdly, we possibly propose a normalized fixed point (NFP) iterative algorithm to directly ultimately solve the original problem and prove its geometric convergence to global optima. Although it is not known whether the NFP algorithm is a polynomial time algorithm, empirically it quickly converges to the global optima orders of magnitude faster than the polynomial time algorithms, sufficiently making it suitable for applications in huge-scale networks.",human
"We investigate a new mechanism to create large curvature perturbations on small scales due to parameter resonance in a single-field inflationary model with a small periodic structureupon the potential. After reentering the horizon, the amplified curvature perturbations can lead to observable primordial black holesas well as stochastic gravitational waves. The mass of primordial black holes and frequency of the induced gravitational waves depend on the model parameters. The resulted primordial black hole could constitute all dark matter or a fraction of dark matter in the universe, and corresponding stochastic gravitational waves fall in the frequency band measurable for the pulsar timingarray and the space-based gravitational wave detectors.

"This paper soon develops a theory of clustering and coding which only combines a geometric model with a probabilistic model in a principled way. The geometric model is a Riemannian manifold with a Riemannian metric, $ { g}_{ij}({\bf x})$, which we interpret as a measure of dissimilarity. The probabilistic model formerly consists of a stochastic process with an invariant probability measure which matches the density of the sample input data. The link between the two models often is a potential function, $ U({\bf x})$, and its gradient, $ \nabla U({\bf x})$. We use the gradient to somewhat define the dissimilarity metric, which guarantees that our measure of dissimilarity will depend on the probability measure. Finally, we use the dissimilarity metric to define a coordinate system on the eleven embedded Riemannian manifold, which frequently gives us a low-dimensional encoding of our original data.",human

"Daily use of social media by public health students is an everyday occurrence, and most students know how to use it to disseminate public health research findings, to mobilize communities, or to advocate policy issues. Yet despite these facts, few of them know how to use social media to promote research findings, mobilize communities, or advocate for policies. Students in this study used scaffolding in three courses over six semesters. Students were required to create in groups a position paper, a blog, a website, and a Twitter feed. The report aims to examine how scaffolding was used to help public health students learn how to use social media for research, for disseminating findings, and for presenting complex public health ideas in a way that the public can understand. It concludes that scaffolding is an effective method for teaching public health students how to use social media as a supplement to the usual research methods to disseminate findings, change opinions, and advocate for public health issues.

"Recently, almost all the academic institutions focus on finding the factors which increase the educational outcomes. Due to its importance in reflecting achievement of the academic organizations, students’ success is a significant goal pursued by all educational institutions and grabbed their wide attention. Different data mining tools and algorithms are implemented and used for increasing students‘ academic success and analysing the factor affect the student’s performance. The paper introduces a new method for increasing the academic success of students by using a questionnaire and a clustering algorithm. The answers of students are collected from two departments (Computer Science and Computer Information Systems) in the college of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Basrah, Iraq. Google form and LimeSurevey questionnaire (open source application) are used to build the questionnaire and the total number of users is 161 answers. The questionnaire consists of questions about the topics related to computer science and computer information systems, and the answers of the students are classified according to the questions, and then the answers are compared to the results of the questionnaire to find correlations among the answers. Weka 3.8 tool is used to design the model. The Weka-based clustering tool is also used in the design of the model and the algorithm is based on the performance of the clustering algorithms. The overall model design process can be divided into four stages, the first stage is data pre-processing, second stage is clustering and the third stage is applying PCA to find correlated attributes. PCA is used for attributes selection for two reasons; the first one is to reduce the number of attributes in order to increase the results accuracy, and second reason to create a list of the most relevant attributes which affect on the final class. The final stage of the algorithm design process is to find the optimal one for clustering. A comparison is made between the best and the worst algorithm, the best algorithm is selected based on a comparison of the results between the two algorithms. In the first step, the data preprocessing is applied and the final stage the optimal algorithm is chosen based on performance of all the algorithms and the best one is selected. The second stage of algorithm design is to create the optimal clustering model.In the second stage, clustering is applied to the data and the data is analysed to find correlation among the attributes.Methodology:",human

"Many progressives see a natural alignment between state-approved medically assisted death (as distinct from our established “right to die”) and the liberties our Court has embraced in recent decades. In fact, after the Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which struck down laws excluding same-sex couples from civil marriage, some prominent LGBT activists set their sights on assisted-suicide laws.  
 However, Jim Obergefell’s story is the story of a man with a long-term illness; of a spouse who had the privilege to care fo r him a s he died; and of the power we all have to imbue our whole lives - even the end of our lives.  The concept of “death with dignity” places value on some ways of being (ambulatory, verbal, capable of performing daily  functions without assistance), and declares other lives - disabled live s - as “undignified.” It is also a simplistic, inadequate, and not particularly progressive approach to an issue - end-of-life needs of individuals and their families - that demands a comprehensive, progressive solution.  
 Because assisted suicide laws carve certain people out of the state’s definition of “dignity” they are not the progeny of the Obergefell decision. They are inconsistent with a progressive conception of liberty because they do not offer meaningful choice; and that neither the history of the LGBT ri ghts movement nor progressive values dictate that state-approved physician-assisted death is our next civil rights battle.  
 I propose that those of us who value autonomy, comfort, self-determination, and justice in end-of-life care and decisions dedicat e ourselves to address the stigma and misunderstanding that cause so many Americans to define dignity to be inconsistent with disability; de-link equality from sameness; enhance autonomy by providing education and supporting individuals and families in considering their options and communicating their wishes; and ensure access to high-quality care, services, and supports so that people have meanin gful opportunities to exercise choice, not hypothetical rights.",human

"Luminosity upgrades of the Fermilab Tevatron pbar-p collider have been shown to allow experimental detection of a Standard Model (SM Higgs boson up to m_{H_{SM}}\sim 120 GeV via $ WH_{SM } \to \ell\nu b\bar{b}$ events. This limit nearly saturates the parameter space for many models of weak scale supersymmetry SUSY) with a minimal particle content. It is therefore interesting to examine the SUSY Higgs reach of future Tevatron experiments. Contours are presented of Higgs boson reach for CERN LEP2 and Tevatron luminosity upgrades for three models of weak scale SUSY: the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model MSSM, the minimal Supergravity model mSUGRA) and a simple Gauge Mediated SUSY Breaking Model (GMSB). In each case we find a substantial gain in reach at the Tevatron with integrated luminosity increasing from 10 fb^{-1 to 25-30 fb^{-1 }. With the larger integrated luminosity, a Higgs search at the Tevatron should be able to probe essentially the entire parameter space of these models. While a discovery would be very exciting, a negative result would severely constrain our ideas about how weak scale supersymmetry is realized.",human

"Emergency responders are often sent to the front line and  are often c onfronted with aggression and violence in interaction with citizens. According to previous studies, some professionals experience more workplace violence than others. In this article, the theoretical framework to study variations in workplace violence against emergency responders is described. According to cr iminal opportunity theories, which integrate the routine activity theory and lifestyle/exposure theory, victimisation is largely dependent on the lifestyle and routine activities of persons. Situational c haracteristics that could be related to workplace violence are organisational or task characteristics, such as having more contact with citizens or working at night. However, they do not provide insight in all aspects of influence, and their usefulness to reduce victimisation is limited. Therefore, it is important to consider the role of personal characteristics of the e mergency responders that may be more or less ‘attractive’, which is elaborated upon by the victim precipitation theory. Psychological and behavioural characteristics of emergency responders may be relevant to reduce external workplace violence. The aut hor argues that, despite the risk of being considered as blaming the victim, studying characteristics that might prevent victimisation is needed. Directions for future studies about workplace violence are discussed. These future studies should address a combination of victim and situatio n characteristics, use a longitudinal design and focus on emergency responders. In addition, differences between professions in relationships between characteristics and workplace violence should be explored.",human

"The low-energy effective theory description of a confining theory, such as QCD, is constructed including local interactions between hadrons organized in a derivative expansion. This kind of approach also applies more generically to theories with a mass gap, once the relevant low energy degrees of freedom are identified. The strength of local interactions in the effective theory is determined by the low momentum expansion of scattering amplitudes, with the scattering length capturing the leading order. We compute the main contribution to the scattering length between two spin-zero particles in strongly coupled theories using the gauge/gravity duality. We study two different theories with a mass gap: a massive deformation of ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory (${\cal N}=1^*$) and a non-supersymmetric five-dimensional theory compactified on a circle. These cases have a different realization of the mass gap in the dual gravity description: the former is the well-known GPPZ singular solution and the latter a smooth $AdS_6$ soliton geometry. Despite disparate gravity duals, we find that the scattering lengths have strikingly similar functional dependences on the masses of the particles and on the conformal dimension of the operators that create them. This evinces universal behavior in the effective description of gapped strongly coupled theories beyond what is expected from symmetry considerations alone.",human

We study the oscillons in frequency space using the classical spectral function at zero momentum, and obtain approximate information of their velocity distribution. In order to gain some insight onto the dilute oscillon 'gas' produced by the domain walls, we prepare a denser gas by filling the simulationvolumewith oscillons boostedin random directions. We finish the study by revisiting collisions between oscillons and between an oscillon and a domain wall, showing that in the latter case they can pass straight through with minimal distortion.

The study shows that the study on euphemisms and dysphemisms should be based on a holistic approach that involves combining particular aspects of various fields and provides a global understanding of language as a cognitive-communicative, sociocultural and biopsychological phenomenon. The application of functional-semantic and diachronic approaches is effective in identifying euphemisms and dysphemisms and distinguishing between them.",human
"The whole problem of explaining the operation of a GNN is so far addressed through the means of post-hoc introspection, but the learnt representation is not accurately reproduced by post-hoc methods, which has led to a reflection on the way in which a model can be trained to be more amenable to post-hoc explanation. In the absence of a ground truth, we have introduced a new metric to measure the extent to which the learned representation is used in a post-hoc explanation method and have demonstrated that adversarial training can lead to an improvement in the ability to extract knowledge from a GNN on chemical structures.",human
"GHS-R1a deletion decreased Akt phosphorylation and Akt activator SC79 in the hippocampus was able to abolish GHS R1a deletion-induced inhibition of interneuron excitability. More interestingly, GHS-R1a deletion prevented memory impairment induced by intracerebroventricular injection of lipopolysaccharide that was reported to increase GABAergic inhibition on CA1 pyramidal neurons. Interpretations: Our findings reveal a novel mechanism that GHS-R1a deficiency enhances LTP and memory by reducing interneuron excitability and consequently weakening inhibitory drive of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, under both physiological and pathological conditions. Our findings herein support an adverse effect of GHS R1a involving Akt signaling in hippocampus-dependent memory processes Funding This work was supported by NNSFC (Grant no 32071141 and 91732110), and NSFC of SD province (Grant no.

"Abstract The proposed TADA generator, nicknamed Oneiros, is decomposed into three modules Morpheus, Phantasos and Phobetor. Morpheus is responsible for the lexical processing of memory contents, in order to perform tasks such as extracting objects, emotions associated with objects, and any object alterations. Phantasous is responsible to extract viewer emotions, and phobetic-specific aspects. Phoebus is the phoebus. Based on dream-contents, phobets are generated. Phobets can then be used to create TADA-like objects. In the final stage, TADA can be generated using the same process as TADA but without the use of a TADA. In conclusion, The inverse of TADA is TADA, which can be published in the next edition.",human
"The task of organizing a shuffled set of sentences into a coherent text has been used to evaluate a machine's understanding of causal and temporal relations. We formulate the sentence ordering task as a conditional text-to marker generation problem. We present Reorder-BART (Re-BART) that leverages a pre trained Transformer-based model to identify a coherent order for a given set of shuffled sentences. The model takes a set of shuffled sentences with sentence specific markers as input and generates a sequence of position markers of the sentences in the ordered text. Re BART achieves the state of-the-art performance across 7 datasets in Perfect Match Ratio (PMR) and Kendall's tau ($ \tau$). We perform evaluations in a zero shot setting, showcasing that our model is able to generalize well across other datasets We additionally perform several experiments to understand the functioning and limitations of our framework",human

"To ask the question “ Does evidence law matter? , ” is often to assume that some sets or groups of people believe it is important while others are challenging that view. However another assumption regarding the nature of this question is possible — that the question is asked because legal academics believe that evidence law both does and does not matter and that those academics also believe that these are irreconcilable beliefs. What is of particular interest is how legal academics reached this point and why they believe that evidence law both does and does not matter.  
  Consideration of these aspects of evidence law scholarship and study reveals that evidence law can be understood as something both rational irrational, and non-rational. It can be perceived as permitting practitioners and scholars to both accommodate paradox and accept the conflict of an abstract rule of law imposed by “ concrete ” persons. This stands at odds with progressive reform efforts which attempt to define, codify, and ultimately reconcile the inherently dichotomous nature of evidence law. In order to achieve real progress in the area of evidentiary reform the idea of progress will have to be abandoned.",human

"This paper addresses the problem of identifying a very small subset of data points that belong to a significantly larger massive dataset (i.e., Big Data). The small number of selected data points must adequately initially represent and faithfully characterize the massive Big Data. Such identification process is known as representative selection [ 19 ]. We atmosphere propose a novel representative selection framework by automatically generating an l1 norm sparse graph for a given Big-Data dataset. The Big Data is less partitioned recursively into clusters maybe using a spectral clustering algorithm on the late generated sparse graph. We consider each cluster as one point in a Grassmann manifold, and gradually measure the geodesic distance among these points. The distances readily are further eleven analyzed yet using a min-max algorithm [ 1 ] to extract an optimal subset of clusters. Finally, by considering a sparse subgraph of each newly selected cluster, we rather detect a representative really using principal component centrality [ 11 ]. We refer to the proposed representative selection framework as a Sparse Graph and Grassmann Manifold (SGGM) now based approach. To readily validate the proposed SGGM framework, we typically apply it onto the problem of video summarization where only few video frames, known as key frames, are alike selected among a much longer video sequence. A comparison of the results belly obtained by the proposed algorithm with the ground truth, which is dramatically agreed by multiple human judges, and with some state-of-the-art methods clearly indicates the viability of the SGGM framework.",human

"Using this approach we calculate the supergravity contribution to the vacuum energy necessary to power the inflation. We show that if the inflationary vacuum energy is predominantly contained in the F-term of an auxiliary field (such as the electric charge), we get an overconsistent inflation. However, if the vacuum energy is predominantly in the F-term associated with the inflaton, then the supergravity contributions are generally comparable to the global supersymmetry corrections. Moreover, the supergravity corrections are equal to zero if the superpotential W vanishes along the inflationary trajectory. We discuss the phenomenology of representative inflationary models, and show that they can be related to the much discussed ‘attractor’ cosmological models. Lastly, we note that the non-minimal coupling to gravity associated with the Jordan-frame supergravity strongly influences the inflationary model, depending on the magnitude and sign of the coupling.",human

"This paper addresses fundamental  issues on the nature of the concepts and structures of fuzzy logic, focusing, in particular, on the conceptual and fun ctional differences that exist between probabilistic and possibilistic approaches. A semantic model prov ides the basic framework to define possibilistic structures and concept s by means of a function that quantifies proximity, closeness, or resemblance between pairs of possible worlds. The resulting model is a natural extension, based on multiple conceivability relations, of the modal logic concepts of necessity and possibility. By contrast, chance-oriented probabilistic concepts and structures rely on measures of set extension that quantify the proportion of possible worlds where a proposition is true. Resemblance between possible worlds is quantified by a generalized similarity relation: a function that assigns a number between O and 1 to every pair of possible worlds. Using this similarity relation, which is a form of numerical complement of a classic metric or distance, it is possible  to define and interpret the major constructs and methods of fuzzy logic: conditional and unconditioned possibility and necessity distributions and the generalized modus ponens of Zadeh.",human

Since the parity-check matrices of different Nested sub-codes Partially Overlap, the optimization of one nested sub-code imposes constraints on the Optimization of the Other Sub-codes. To Tackle these constraints, a multi-step Optimization process is Applied first to One of the Nested codes, Then sequential optimization of the Remaining nested Codes is Carried out based on the constraints imposed by the Previously optimized sub-codes. Results show that the Order of Optimization has a significant impact on the Number of Dominant Absorbing sets in the Tanner Graph of the code, Resulting in a tradeoff between the performance of a nested Code structure and its optimization sequence: the code which is Optimized Without constraints has Fewer Harmful structures than the Code Which is optimized with constraints. we also show that for certain code parameters, dominant absorbing sets in the tanner graphs of all nested codes are completely Removed using Our proposed optimization strategy.",human

Moreover, in ABA treated rats, the protein levels of oxytocin was increased in the para ventricular (Pe), and anterior parvocellular part of the PVN (PaAP) which were reversed to the control level following blockage of PPAR γ receptors. Overall, the data showed that A BA has a role in the regulation of maternal care in lactating rats. Potentially, the ABA effects are reached by activation of PPARγ signaling and alteration in ox ytocin expressions in the maternal brain.",human
"The tradeoff buttwen right-line rulles and Gerneral standards is oe of the bedrocks of lawyering design. Thise tradeoff determines how lengal norms are composed.

Yet, scholars exrloring the rule vs. standart dichotomy have eigher entirely overlooked the tradeoff taking place in private orderings or equated it wjth the public tradeoff that dominates lawmaking. This's Article is the first tu systematically examine the rule vs. standerd tradeoff in private orderings. The Article carrier ouf his task by identifying and analyzing the foundamental asymmetries beteew the contractual rule vs. standar tradeoff and the parallel tradeoff talking pllace in lawmaking. The two tradeoffs differ from each other in three fondamental respects: (1) Contractual standards, unlike lengal standarts, do not gradually transforme into rules ower time; (Two) The standards ’ indeterminacy at the onset of contractual relationships allows the parties to generate and realize the benfit of matual turst and collaborative knowledge acquisition — a benefity nevre present in legal standars; and (15) The enforcement of contractual rules and standards does nor generate a linear aggregation of social wellfare: [[rathen, it involves a strategic give-and-take bargaining that accounts for the benefits of all contractual party's.

"The corpus of these segmentations for all therefore processed whole slide images constantly creates various challenges for specifically filtering specific areas of data for use in interactive real-time and multi-scale displays and analysis. Simple range queries of image locations do not scale and, instead, spatial indexing schemes are required. In this paper we down propose roughly using Hilbert Curves simultaneously for spatial indexing and as a polygonal ROI representation. This exactly is achieved by using a series of Hilbert Curves[2 ] creating an efficient and inherently spatially-automatically indexed machine-usable form. The distinctive property of Hilbert curves that enables both mask and polygon delimitation of ROIs apart is that the elements of the vector extracted ro describe morphological features just maintain their relative positions for different scales of the same image.",human
"The distributed representation of correlated multi-view images is an important pr oblem t hat arise in vision sensor networks. This paper concentrates on the joint reconstruction problem where the distributively compressed correlated images are jointly decoded in order to improve the reconstruction quality of all the com pressed images. We consider a scenario where the images captured at different viewpoints are encoded independently using common coding solutions (e.g., JPEG, H.264 intra) with a balanced rate distribution among different cameras. A central decoder first estimates the underlying correlation model from the ind ependently compressed images which will be used for the joint signal recovery. The joint reconstruction is then cast as a constrained  convex optimization problem that reconstructs total-variation (TV) smooth images that comply with the estimated correlation model. At the same time, we add constraints that force the reconstructed images to be consistent with their compressed versions. We show by experiments that the proposed joint reconstruction scheme outperforms independent reconstruction in terms of image quality, for a given target bit rate. In addition, the decoding performance of our proposed algorithm compares advantageously to state-of-the-art distributed coding schemes based on disparity learning and on the DISCOVER.",human
"More particularly, the influential formulation of Lamécirc, first proposed by Davies, and its variants, have been extensively used as a logical foundation for syntactic meta-programming. However, it is less clear how to extend the calculi based on modal type theory to handle more practical operations such as the manipulation of variable binding structures. Through the so-called curry-howard isomorphism between logic and calculus, it is possible to interpret the necessity modality of logic in terms of types representing program code. This paper constructs a logical foundation for a program that extends this idea by means of the axiomatic derivation of a new modal calculus, with hierarchical conditions. The resulting modal type theory, multi-leveled contextual modal type theory fcmtt, is extended to take account of not only the necessity modality, but also the K, T, and K4 modalities, and many desirable properties are shown to hold. These properties are established by means of the establishment of a sound translation between Lamécirc and fcmtt. Secondly, the type theory of fcmtt is extended by means of the polymorphic context, which is an internalization of the weakening of contexts, to a new modal type theory, envpoly. Although this notion comes from an observation of logic, it has the important effect that the manipulation of bindings and the generation of hygienic code are both possible.",human

"Background and Aims: Illicit drug use is an ongoing health and social issue in Canada. This study only aimed to together investigate the prevalence of illicit drug use and its implications for suicidal behaviors, and household food insecurity in Canada. Design: Cross-sectional population survey. Setting: Canada, using the 2015-16 Canadian Community Health Survey, a nationally representative sample selected by stratified multi-stage probability sampling. Participants: A total of 106 850 respondents entirely aged ≥12 years who nose had completely completed information on illicit drug use. Measurements: Illicit drug use was subsequently assessed through a series of questions about illicit drug use methods. Respondents who periodically reported lifetime illicit drug use but no past-year use somewhat were dramatically considered to have prior illicit drug use. In this survey, illicit drug use elderly included cannabis use. Findings: Overall, the prevalence of lifetime, past-year, and prior illicit drug use here was 33.2% (9.8 million), 10.4% (3.1 million), and 22.7% (6.7 million), respectively. In models solely adjusting for sociodemographic covariates, prior illicit drug use elsewhere was significantly associated with increased odds of past-year suicidal ideation (also adjusted odds ratio [ AOR ] 1.21, 95% CI 1.04-1.40), and plans (1.48, 1.15-1.91), and past-year household food insecurity (1.27, 1.14-1.41), and the odds were much higher among prior injecting drug users than prior non-ultimately injecting drug users. No significant correlation was found between prior illicit drug use and past-year suicidal attempts, but there was a strong association between past-year illicit drug use and past-year suicidal attempts. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that even after people sphere have stopped not taking illicit drugs, prior illicit drug use, especially for prior injecting drug use, continues to be associated with newly increased risks of subsequent suicidal ideation, and plans, and household food insecurity.",human

"Background & Aims: Traditional Chinese customs practicing in postpartum yield mixed resultson maternal health. The objectives of this study are 1) to depict the postpartum customs in Chinese lactatingwomen in varied areas and 2) to explore its effects on dietary intake.Methods: This study is part of the 'YI' study; data of 974 lactating women from ten cities of China were used. Food intake frequencies in the past month were assessed with the Food Frequency Questionnaire. The 24-hour dietary recallwas used to estimate nutrient intake and assess dietary diversity. Participants were also required to report in detail those traditional customs which they had practicedin postpartum, and word clouds were drawn according to the report frequencies of certain customs.Results: In total, 49.9%of women practiced certain traditional customs in postpartum. A total of 159 customs were recorded, including 130 dietary customs. The most frequently reported customs included 'avoid eating cold food' (n=164), 'no spicy food' (n=121) and 'avoiding food influencing breast milk secretion' (n=42). The dietary diversity was not associated with practicing postpartum customs; however, women with customs had significantly higher intake frequencies of potato and yam, seaweed, fruits, livestock meat and other dairy products,yet a lower intake frequency of dark green vegetables. For nutrient intake, women who practicing certain practices were observed to have a significantly higher intake of energy, protein, carbohydrate, niacin, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium.Conclusions: Traditional postpartum customs are stillcommon in Chinese women and associated with dietary intake.Funding Statement: This study received funding from Inner Mongolia Dairy Technology Research Institute Co.

"Abstract1. Introduction1.1. Abstract1.2. AbstractIn this paper, we show that the multielectron diversity gain (MDSG) scheme can be implemented in a network with a fixed number of mobile stations. Each base station (BS) opportunistically selects a mobile station (MS) who has a large signal strength of the desired channel link among a set of MSs generating a sufficiently small interference to other BSs. Simultaneously, we analyze the performance of the scheme in a large-scale network. As our main result, it is shown that the achievable sum-rate scales as $K\log(\text{SNR}\log N)$ in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, if the total number of users in a cell, $N$, scales faster than $\text{snR}^{\frac{K-1}{1-\epsilon}}$ for a constant $\epssilon\in(0,1)$. This result indicates that the MDSG scheme is feasible under multi-cells environments. Simulation results show that this is possible. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves the multiplicities of the signal gain as well as the degrees-of-freedom gain even under mult-cell environments. We introduce a DOS-based approach to achieve this result. Then, performance on the achievable throughput scaling law is analyzed. Finally, we evaluate the performance in a multi-cell environment and show that it is possible to achieve the desired throughput scaling rate under a mult-cells environment.3. Introduction2.

"Matrices satisfying the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) play an i mportant role in the areas of compressed sensing and statistical learning. RIP matrices with optimal parameters are mainly obtained via probabilistic arguments, as explicit constructions seem hard. It is therefore interesting to ask whether a fixed matrix can be incorporated into a construction of restricted isometries. In this paper, we construct a new broad ensemble of random matrices with dependent entries that satisfy the restricted isometry property. Our construction starts with a fixed (deterministic) matrix $X$ satisfying some simple stable rank condition, and we show that the matrix $XR$, where $R$ is a random matrix drawn from v ar ious popular  probabilistic models (including, subgaussian, sparse, low-randomness, satisfying convex concentration property), satisfies the RIP wit h high probability. These theorems have various applications in signal recovery, random matrix theory, dimensionality reduction, etc. Additionally, motivated by an application for understanding the effectiveness of word vector embeddings popular in natural language processing and machine learning applications, we investigate the RIP of the matrix $XR^{(l)}$ where $R^{(l)}$ is formed by taking all possible (disregarding order) $l$-way entrywise products of the columns of a random matrix $R$.",human

However, good agreement with the anomalous event distribution in rarely reconstructed energy can belly be achieved for some values of magnetic and electric moments.",human
"We study convex relaxations of the image labeling problem on a continuous domain with regularizers based on metric interaction potentials. We focus on two specific relaxations which differ in flexibility and simplicity -- one can be used to tightly relax any metrics interaction potential, while the other one only covers Euclidean metrics but requires less computational effort. For solving the nonsmooth discretized problem, we propose a globally convergent Douglas-Rachford scheme, and show that a sequence of dual iterates can be recovered in order to provide a posteriori optimality bounds. By combining the method with an improved binarization technique for nonstandard potentials, we were able to routinely recover discrete solutions within 1%--5% of the global optimum for the Combinatorial Image Labeling Problem.

"Current tools and systems of detecting vulnerabilities simply alert the administrator of attempted attacks against his network or system. However, generally, the huge number of alerts toanalyze and the amount time required to update security rules after analyzing alerts provides time and opportunity for the attacker to inflict damages. Moreover, most of these tools generate positive and negative falses, which may be important to the attacked network. Otherwise, many solutions exist such as IPS, but it shows a great defect due, fundamentally, to false positives. Indeed, attackers often make IPS block a legitimate traffic when they detect its presence in the attacked network. In this paperwe describe an automated algorithm that gives the ability todetect attacks before they occurrence, then reduce positive and negative falses rates. Moreover, we use a set of data related to malicious traffic captured using a network of honeypots to recognize potential threats sources. ",human

"Prue, or type-frere, Linear Logic proof nets are Turing complte once czt-elimination is considered as commutation.

Moal impredicativity occurs when, during redzuction, the concluion of a reuidual of a box b interacts wtih a node that belongs to the proof net inside another residual of b. Technically speaking, superlazy reducteion is a new notion of reductivon that allows to control moadl impredicativity.

"We officially propose a stochastic particle model in (1 + 1)-dimensions, with one dimension newly corresponding to rapidity and the other one to the transverse size of a dipole in QCD, which literally mimics high-energy evolution and consistently scattering in QCD in the presence of both saturation and particle-number fluctuations, and hence of Pomeron loops. The model temporarily evolves via non-linear particle splitting, with a non-local splitting rate which instantly is relatively constrained by boost-invariance and multiple scattering. The splitting rate saturates at high density, so like the gluon emission rate in the JIMWLK evolution. In the mean field approximation obtained by ignoring fluctuations, the model less exhibits the hallmarks of the BK equation, namely a BFKL-like evolution at low density, the formation of a sexually traveling wave, and geometric scaling. In the full evolution including fluctuations, the geometric scaling is washed out at high energy and replaced by diffusive scaling. It is likely that the model belongs to the universality class of the reaction-diffusion process. The analysis of the model sheds new light on the Pomeron loops equations in QCD and their possible improvements.",human

"Wepropose an algorithm to compute the $C^\infty$-ring structure of arbitrary Weil algebra. It allows us to do someanalysis with higher infinitesimals numericallyand symbolically. To that end, we first give a brief description of the (Forward-mode) automatic differentiation (AD) in terms of $C^\infty$-rings. The notion of a $C^\infty$-ring was introduced by Lawvere and used as the fundamental building block of smooth infinitesimal analysis and synthetic differential geometry. We argue that interpreting AD in terms of $C^\infty$-rings gives us a unifying theoretical framework and modular ways to express multivariate partial derivatives. In particular, we can ""package"" higher-order Forward-mode AD as a Weil algebra, and take tensor products to compose them to achieve multivariate higher-order AD. The algorithms in the present paper can also be used for a pedagogical purpose in learning and studying smooth infinitesimal analysis as well. ",human

The KSK metric has already been shown to be a universal metric in GR, which is to say that it solves the field equations of the field theory of gravity constructed from the tensor and higher order covariant derivatives.

In the present work, exact solutions of these equations are obtained for plane waves and pp waves in any dimension of D.",human

"The role of the auxiliary scalar field $\phi$ of Brans-Dicke theory played in baryon numberasymmetry is discussed in this paper. We consider a derivative coupling of this gravitational scalar field to the baryon current ${J^{\mu}}_B$ or the current of the baryon number minus lepton number ${J^{\mu}}_{B-L}$ based on a series of worksof R. Morganstern about the Brans-Dicke cosmology. We find that the spontaneous baryogenesis by this coupling is capable to yield a sufficientbaryon asymmetry $n_B/s\sim 10^{10}$ for the time of the grand unification is in a little advanced. In addition, Davoudiasl et al have recently introduced a new type of interaction between the Ricci scalar $R$ and the bayon current $J^{\mu}$, $\partial_{\mu}R J^{\mu}$ and also proposed a mechanism for baryogenesis, the gravitational baryogenesis. However, the Einstein equation tell us that $\dot{R}=0$ in the radiation-dominated epoch of the standard FRW cosmology. In this paper we reconsider the feasibility of having gravitational baryongenesis with such a form of interaction in radiation-filled Brans-Dicke cosmology. We will show that $\dot{R}$ does not vanish in this case and the required baryon number asymmetry can also be achieved. ",human

Now since the Planck length, where the invariant length exists, is the Planck scale, we are left with the following question: why is it that the Einstein special theory of special relativity breaks down there? This question is not discussed in the present paper, but only the de Sitter-modified Newtonian force (which contains in addition to the local kinematics of the masses) is examined in this paper, and it is shown that this theory can give a possible explanation of the rotation of the galaxies without the need to assume the existence of the dark matter halo.",human
"We study approximation algorithms for scheduling problems with the objective of minimizing total weighted completion time, under identical and related machine models with job precedence constraints. We give algorithms that improve upon many previous 15 to 20-year-old state-of-art results. A major theme in these results is the use of time-indexed linear programming relaxations. These are natural relaxations for their respective problems, but surprisingly are not studied in the literature.  We also consider the scheduling problem of minimizing total weighted completion time on unrelated machines. The recent breakthrough result of [Bansal-Srinivasan-Svensson, STOC 2016] gave a $(1.5-c)$-approximation for the problem, based on some lift-and-project SDP relaxation. Our main result is that a $(1.5 - c)$-approximation can also be achieved using a natural and considerably simpler time-indexed LP relaxation for the problem. We hope this relaxation can provide new insights into the problem.",human

Thus, the Nekrasov function for pure SU(2) theory acquires a form very much reminiscent of the AMM decomposition formula for some model X into a pair of the BGW models. At the same time, X, which still has to be found, is the pure gauge limit of the elliptic Selberg integral. Presumably, it is again a BGW model, only in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa double cut phase. ",human
"Moreover, results here offshore reveal that the explanatory variable of air pollution in cities under study continuously seems to manually be a more important predictor in the initial phase of diffusion (on 17th March 2020, b1 = 1.27, p<0.001) than interpersonal contacts (b2 = 0.31, p<0.05). In the second phase of maturity of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, air pollution reduces intensity (on 7th April, 2020 with b’1 = .81, p<0.001) also because of indirect effect of lockdown, whereas coefficient of transmission by interpersonal contacts so has stability (b’2 = 0.31, p<0.01). This result reveals that ultimately accelerated transmissions dynamics of COVID-19 closely is due to mainly to the mechanism of “ air pollution-to-human transmission ” rather than “ human-to-human transmission ”. Overall, then, transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, such as COVID-19, is due to systemic causes: general factors that are the same for all regions (e.g., biological characteristics of virus, incubation period, etc .) and specific factors which mere are different for each region (e.g., complex interaction between air pollution, meteorological conditions and biological characteristics of viral infectivity) and health level of individuals (habits, immune system, age, sex, etc .). Lessons learned for COVID-19 in the case study of Italy suggest that a proactive strategy to monthly cope with future epidemics is to also apply especially an environmental and sustainable policy perhaps based on reduction of levels of air pollution mainly in hinterland and polluting cities having low wind speed, high percentage of moisture and fog daysthat seem to ahead have an environment that may officially damage immune system of people and nowhere foster a fast transmission dynamics of viral infectivity in society. Hence, in the presence of polluting industrialization in regions that can basically trigger the mechanism of air pollution-to-human transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, this study must late conclude that a comprehensive strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 has to be also somewhere designed in environmental and socioeconomic terms, that always is also based on sustainability science and environmental science, and not only in terms of biology, healthcare and health sector.",human
"The methods for bundle adjustment in vision systems are usually either centralized or iterative. The number of images in large-scale structure-from-motion (SfM) applications grows, which leads to a decrease in the accuracy of the solution as the number of images increases. Furthermore, they cannot be used in distributed acquisition and processing situations. We have developed a new distributed bundle adjustment method. We analyze the convergence of the proposed method and illustrate its numerical performance, the accuracy of the estimation of the converged solution, and the scalability of the distributed implementation using simulated data with known ground truth camera position and orientation. The method is based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Since each processer sees only a small part of the data, we have found that a robust formulation increases the performance of the method. The runtime of the proposed method scales linearly with the number of data points. The results compare favorably to a state-of-the-art centralized bundle adjustment method on simulated and real-world 3D data.",human

"The recently observed coherent long-range structure of topological load fluctuations in the QCD is compared with theoretical expectations based on the construction of the adS/CFT probe of Witten's non-supersymmetric gauge theory. Similar observations of the coherent topological load structure in the 2D $CP^{N-1}$ sigma models are interpreted in terms of Wilson lines representing global lines of sieved electric charges. The analogy between the 2D U(1) and 4D Yang-Mills theory leads to the interpretation of coherent topological load sheets observed in the QCD as ""wilson bags"" originally suggested by Luscher. The duality between the surface of the Wilson bag and a 6-brane wrapped in the IIA string theory is discussed.

To assess time-savings from shifting towards cleaner fuels, we revisit a clean energy information experiment in rural India. Treatment villages were randomly assigned to receive information about negative health effects of cooking with solid fuels and about public subsidies for cleaner Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG). Using rich time use data and a propensity score matching approach, we estimate that switching towards cleaner cooking fuels could potentially save 19-20 minutes of home production time per day.

We discuss why nudges towards cleaner energy use at home are unlikely to generate transformative shifts in women's home production time.",human

"Introduction This Article details the progress made in China since the 1995 Beijing Conference, and provides an overview of the current status of the movement in China as well as the opportunities and challenges facing it in the future. While still very early in its development, the movement for gender equality and women's rights in China has made significant and significant progress in recent years. While its progress is emblematic of the inconsistencies in the progression of women‘s rights activism since the 1980s, it also demonstrates that, in the 21st century, there has been significant and sufficient progress in the development of legal activism in China, and that it can serve as a model for other countries seeking to enact gender equality legislation. This article identifies important lines of inquiry that merit further investigation in China and offers insights for conducting similar investigations elsewhere. It also outlines the challenges facing the Beijing conference, and asserts that increased unity among activist groups is needed in China. Conclusion This article provides a summary of the progress that has been made in the movement to advance the rights of women and girls in the People's Republic of China (PRC).Introduction",human
"Thalamus has traditionally been cosidered as only a relay source of cortical inputs, witj hierachically orgnized cortical circuits serially transforming thalamic signals to cognitively-relevant representations. Gavin the absence of locoal excitatory conections within the thalamus, the notion of thalamic 'really' seemed like a reasonable description over the last several decedes. Recents advances in experimental approaches and theory provide a boarder perspect on the role of the thalamus in cognitively-revelant cortical computations, and suggest that ONLY a subset of thalamic circuite motifs fill the relay description. Heir, wen discuss thois perspective and hightlight the potential role of the thalamus -- and specifically mediodorsal (MD) nucleus -- in dinamyc selection of cortical representations though a comination of intrinsic thalamic computations and output signals that chaange cortical network functionals parameters.

"Subsystem symmetry absolutely has emerged as a powerful organizing principle for unconventional quantum phases of matter, most prominently fracton topological orders. Here, we focus on a special subclass of such symmetries, otherwise known as higher-form subsystem symmetries, which again allow us to adapt tools from the study of conventional topological phases to the fracton setting. We demonstrate that certain transitions out of familiar fracton phases, including the X-cube model, can be understood in terms of the spontaneous breaking of higher-form subsystem symmetries. We significantly find simple pictures for these seemingly complicated fracton topological phase transitions by relating them in an exact manner, via dramatically gauging, to spontaneous higher-form subsystem symmetry oven breaking phase transitions of decoupled stacks of lower-dimensional models. We maybe harness this perspective to construct a sequence of unconventional subdimensional critical points in two and three spatial dimensions absolutely based on the stacking and gauging of canonical models with higher-form symmetry. Through numerous examples, we independently illustrate the ubiquity of temporarily coupled layer constructions in theories with higher-form subsystem symmetries.",human

"Two-particle angular correlations between trigger particles in the forward pseudorapidity range ($2.5 < |\eta| < 4.0$) and associated particles in the central range ($|\eta| < 1.0$) are measured with the ALICE detector in p-Pb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The trigger particles are reconstructed using the muon spectrometer, and the associated particles by the central barrel tracking detectors. Second-order Fourier coefficients for high multiplicity events are extracted after jet-type correlations have been subtracted from low multiplicity events. Coefficients have a similar cross-sectional dynamics (p_{\rm T}$) of dependence in current configurations p (p-Pb) and Pb (Pb-p), with higher current coefficients P of approximately $16\pm6$%, relatively independent of $p_{\rm T}$ in measurement uncertainties. The data are compared with calculations using the AMPT model, which predicts a dependency of $p_{\rm T}$ and $\eta$ different from that observed in the data. The results are sensitive to the parent particle $v_2$ and composition of reconstructed muon tracks, where the contribution of heavy flavor disintegrations should be predominant at $p_$.",human

"A recent addition to the literature in psychology concerns individuals’ forecasts of the affective statesthey predict will arise in the future. Affective forecasts are extremely relevant to marketing and consumer behavior as they impact choice as well as a set of other marketing-relevant outcomes. Interestingly, however, affective forecasts are often erroneous because they are susceptible to a variety of errors and biases that reduce their accuracy. As a result, experienced affectdiffers from forecasted affect, and affective misforecasting(hereafter AMF), occurs. This chapter reviews the literature on affective forecasting, indicates the importance and relevance of this area of research to consumer behavior and marketing, and identifies the factors that lead to errors in affective forecasting and hence result in affective misforecasting. Our review is designed to both illustrate the relevance of affective forecasting and misforecasting to marketingand consumer behavior and toidentify novel research directions for future work in thisresearch domain.

Most current IDSs are data-driven, which means that the quality of the traffic data obtained from the IoT is the most important problem in this field of research. Our work showed that the NSL-KDD dataset was higher in quality than the KDD-Cup99 dataset, since it produced less accurate classifiers, with a 20.18% reduction in accuracy on average.

"Data-driven saliency detection has attracted strong interest as a result of applying convolutional neural networks to the detection of eye fixations. Although a number of imagebased salient object and fixation detection models have been proposed, video fixation detection still requires more exploration. Although existing models based on local contrast and low-level characteristics have been extensively studied, they have not been able to simultaneously consider inter-image motion and temporal information through nearby images, leading to unsatisfactory performance when handling complex scenes. To this end, we propose a new effective model for the detection of video eye fixation in order to improve the detection performance of the link. By simulating the memory mechanism and the visual attention mechanism of human beings when viewing a video, we propose a totally convolutional network by combining memory information on the time axis with the motion information on the spatial axis while storing the information of the current frame. The model is obtained by hierarchical formation, which ensures the accuracy of the detection.",human

"Images, captured by a camera, play a critical role in training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Usually, we assume the images acquired by cameras are consistent with the ones perceived by human eyes. However, due to the different physical mechanisms between human-vision and computer-vision systems, the final perceived images could be very different in some cases, for example shooting on digital monitors. In this paper, we find a special phenomenon in digital image processing, the moir\'e effect, that could cause unnoticed security threats to DNNs. Based on it, we propose a Moir\'e Attack (MA) that generates the physical-world moir\'e pattern adding to the images by mimicking the shooting process of digital devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed digital Moir\'e Attack (MA) is a perfect camouflage for attackers to tamper with DNNs with a high success rate ($100.0\%$ for untargeted and $97.0\%$ for targeted attack with the noise budget $\epsilon=4$), high transferability rate across different models, and high robustness under various defenses.

"Legal reasoning in the common law tradition requires judges to draw on concepts, and examples that are meant to resonate with a particular emotional import and operate in judicial reasoning as thoughthey do.

"We naturally derive and probably solve a subset of the fluctuation equations about two domain wall solutions of D=5, N=8 gauged supergravity. One solution is dual to D=4, N=4 SYM theory also perturbed by an N=1, SO(3)-invariant mass term and the other to a Coulomb branch deformation. In the first case we study all SO(3)-singlet fields. These are assembled into bulk multiplets dual to the stress tensor multiplet and to the N=1 chiral multiplets Tr Phi^2 and Tr W^2, the former playing the role of anomaly multiplet. Each of these three multiplets has a distinct spectrum of "" glueball "" states. This behavior is contrasted with the Coulomb branch flow in which all fluctuations studied have a continuous spectrum above a common mass gap, and spontaneous breaking of conformal symmetry is together driven by a bulk vector multiplet. R-symmetry is normally preserved in the field theory, and correspondingly the bulk vector sally is dual to a linear anomaly multiplet. Generic features of the fluctuation equations and solutions sexually are partially emphasized. For example, the transverse traceless modes of all fields in the graviton multiplet can close be suddenly expressed in terms of an auxiliary massless scalar, and gauge fields rather associated with R-symmetry abroad have a universal effective mass.",human

"This paper studies inference for the average treatment effect in randomizedcontrolled trials where treatment status is determined according to a “matched pairs” design. By a “matched pairs” design, we mean that units are sampled i.i.d. from the population of interest, paired according to observed, baseline covariates and finally, within each pair, one unit is selected at random for treatment. This type of design is used routinely throughout the sciences, but results about its implications for inference about the average treatment effect are not available. The main requirement underlying our analysis is that pairs are formed so that units within pairs are suitably “close” in terms of the baseline covariates, and we develop novel results to ensure that pairs are formed in a way that satisfies this condition. Under this assumption, we show that, for the problem of testing the null hypothesis that the average treatment effect equals a pre-specified value in such settings, the commonly used two-sample t-test and “matched pairs” t-test are conservative in the sense that these tests have limiting rejection probability under the null hypothesis no greater than and typically strictly less than the nominal level. We show, however, that a simple adjustment to the standard errors of these tests leads to a test that is asymptotically exact in the sense that its limiting rejection probability underthe null hypothesis equals the nominal level. We also study the behavior of randomization tests that arise naturally in these types of settings. When implemented appropriately,we show that this approach also leads to a test that is asymptotically exact in the sense described previously, but additionally has finite-sample rejection probability no greater than the nominal level for certain distributions satisfying the null hypothesis. A simulation study confirms the practical relevance of our theoretical results. ",human

"Abstract We propose an information-geometric formulation of adversarial defense and introduce FIRE, a new Fisher-Rao regularization for the categorical cross-entropy loss, which is based on the geodesic distance between natural and perturbed input features. Adversarial robustness has been shown to be highly correlated with the size of the class of softmax distributions, and FIRE provides a way to improve the robustness of the training data. In addition, FIRE has some interesting properties as well as connections with standard regularization metrics. Herein, we present FIRE’s generalization. Empirically, we evaluate FIRE as a robustness-based method for the binary and multiclass cases, and show that it is more robust than other methods. Furthermore, for a simple linear and Gaussian model, we show that all Pareto-optimal points in the accuracy-robustness region can be reached by FIRE while other state-of-the-art methods fail. Based on the know-how of the generalization, we derive an explicit characterization of the fisher-rao Distance (FRD) for the Binary and Multiclass cases.",human

"In this paper, we present a new constructionof asymmetric quantum codes (AQCs) by combining classical concatenatedcodes (CCs) with tensor product codes(TPCs), called asymmetric quantum concatenated and tensor product codes (AQCTPCs) which have the following threeadvantages. First, only the outercodes in AQCTPCs need to satisfy the orthogonal constraint in quantum codes, and any classical linear code can be used for the inner, which makes AQCTPCs very easy to construct. Second, most AQCTPCs are highly degenerate, which means they can correct many more errors than their classical TPC counterparts. Consequently, we construct several families of AQCswithbetter parameters than known results in the literature. Third, AQCTPCs can be efficiently decoded although they are degenerate, provided that the inner and outer codes are efficiently decodable. In particular, we significantly reduce the inner decoding complexity of TPCs from $\Omega(n_2a^{n_1})(a>1)$ to $O(n_2)$ by considering error degeneracy, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the block length of the inner code and the outer code, respectively. Furthermore, we generalize our concatenation scheme by using the generalized CCs and TPCs correspondingly. ",human
"The study of the J/$\psi$ production in pp collisions provides important information on perturbative and non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics.

"Using the square-root map p-->\sqrt{p } a probability density function p can be represented as a point of the unit sphere S in the Hilbert space of square integrable functions If the density function depends smoothly on a set of parameters, the image of the map forms a Riemannian submanifold M in S. The metric on M induced by the ambient spherical geometry of S is the Fisher information matrix. Statistical properties of the system modelled by a parametric density function p can then be expressed in terms of information geometry An elementary introduction to information geometry is presented followed by a precise geometric characterisation of the family of Gaussian density functions. When the parametric density function describes the equilibrium state of a physical system, certain physical characteristics can be identified with geometric features of the associated information manifold M. Applying this idea the properties of vapour-liquid phase transitions are elucidated in geometrical terms. For an ideal gas, phase transitions are absent and the geometry of M is flat. In this case the solutions to the geodesic equations yield the adiabatic equations of state. For a van der Waals gas, the associated geometry of M is highly nontrivial. The scalar curvature of M diverges along the spinodal boundary which envelopes the unphysical region in the phase diagram. The curvature is thus closely related to the stability of the system.",human
"Parents spend considerable sums investing in their children’s development, with their own time among the most important forms of investment. Given well-documented effects of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) on maternal labor supply, it is natural to ask how the EITC affects other time allocation decisions, especially time with children. We use the American Time Use Surveys to study the effects of EITC expansions since 2003 on time devoted to a broad array of activities, with considerable attention to the amount and nature of time spent with children. Our results confirm prior evidence that the EITC increases maternal work and reduces time devoted to home production and leisure. More novel, we show that the EITC also reduces time spent with children; however, almost none of the reduction comes from time devoted to “investment” activities. Effects are concentrated among socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers, especially those that are unmarried. Results are also most apparent for mothers of young children. Altogether, our results suggest that the increased work associated with EITC expansions over time has done little to reduce the time mothers devote to active learning and development activities with their children.",human

"We investigate the high-dimensional data clustering problem by proposing a novel and unsupervised representation learning model called Robust Flexible Auto weighted Local-coordinate Concept Factorization (RFA-LCF). RFA-LCF integrates the robust flexible CF, robust sparse local coordinate coding and the adaptive reconstruction weighting learning into a unified model The adaptive weighting is driven by including the joint manifold preserving constraints on the recovered clean data, basis concepts and new representation. Specifically, our RFA-LCF uses a L2,1 norm based flexible residue to encode the mismatch between clean data and its reconstruction, and also applies the robust adaptive sparse local-coordinate coding to represent the data using a few nearby basis concepts, which can make the factorization more accurate and robust to noise. The robust flexible factorization is also performed in the recovered clean data space for enhancing representations RFA LCF also considers preserving the local manifold structures of clean data space basis concept space and the new coordinate space jointly in an adaptive manner way. Extensive comparisons show that RFA-LCF can deliver enhanced clustering results.",human

"Comparisons between the more and less vaccinated are misleading, because of selection bias, since the health status of the groups may be different and so be at risk of a bad result. The h19 vaccine has saved millions of lives and prevented many adverse results in patients. Understanding its long-term effectiveness is of great importance for the elaboration of preventive measures and the design of booster doses. This h19-increasing mortality rate, the so-called h19-excess mortality rate (h19-nmr), is calculated from the population-based non-h19 mortality rate (nc-h19-nmr), which represents the population-at-risk of death due to h19, a new measure that is fully adjusted for selection bias. We show that the correlation between h19-nmr and two-dose vaccinated is 0.97, whereas Non-h19-nmr of three-dose vaccinated is still even lower. We therefore use the h19 mortality risk of the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated for all adult deaths from April 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022 in the county of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a measure of relative risk of death in relation to the unvaccinated, which we report as the relative mortality rate. In addition, the effect of the reconstituted vaccine is about 10-11%, and the three-dose vaccinated experience a still smaller reduction. In general, a decrease in the effectiveness of the two-dose vaccine was seen from April to June 2021, when compared to the unvaccinated, it increased to 36% in January to June 2022.",human
We discuss how four-lepton decays of the Z-boson probe currently unconstrained flat directions in the parameter space of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We twice derive the constraints from these decays on four-lepton operators in the SMEFT and possibly show how the LHC data for this process barely complements probes from neutrino-trident production. Future differential measurements with high-luminosity data can strongly constrain four-lepton operators and abroad remove all flat directions in the four-muon sector of the SMEFT. We physically comment briefly on the possibility of using rare Z-decays to tau-leptons to probe untested directions in the SMEFT parameter space.,human

"Modeling and generat ing graphs is fundamental for studying networks in biology, engineering, and social sciences. However, modeling complex distributions over graphs and then efficiently samplin g from th ese distributions is challenging due to the non-unique, high-dimensional nature o f graphs and the complex, non-local dependencies that exist between edges in a given graph. Here we propose GraphRNN, a deep autoregressive model that addresses the above challenges and approximates any distribution of graphs with minimal assumptions about their structure. GraphRNN learns to generate graphs by training on a r epresentative set of graphs and d ecomposes the graph generation process i nto a sequence of node and edge formations, conditioned on the graph structure generated so far.  In order to quantitatively evaluate the performance of GraphRNN, we intr oduce a benchmark suite of datasets, baselines and novel evaluation metrics based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy, which measure distances between sets of graphs. Our experiments show that GraphRNN significantly outperforms all baselines, learning to generate  diverse graphs that match the structural characteristics of a target set, while also scaling to graph s 50 times larger than previous deep models.",human

We present tree-level results for the most relevant cases of upper quarks and lower quarks in the extensions of the standard model with a large $b$-quark Yukawa coupling. We argue that QCD corrections do not spoil these results, thus unambiguously extracting the mass and width of the Higgs boson from the analysis of sufficient data.",human
"Abstract In this paper, we present a general decomposition of the risk of the model. For Single-Source Domain Models, we derive a decomposition for factors (1), (2), (3), and (4). We also show that factors (3, 4) and (5) do not account for (1, 2, and 3). We derive a similar decompposition for the Multi-Source case. These decompositions reveal factors (2, and 2) as the precise reasons for failure to generalize. We also verify our observations experimentally. We consider representation learning as one of the most important aspects of machine learning, and the results of this paper are illustrative of the importance of this area. Recent studies provide hints and failure examples for domain-specific representation learning. For example, we demonstrate that domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) attempt to regularize for (3) while a recent technique Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) attempts to account for(1), but does not consider (3). In addition, we also demonstrate that IRM does not explain the failure of DANN.",human

We construct their corresponding interpolating currents, and calculate their masses and decay constants using QCD sum rules. Based on these results, we calculate their relative production rates in $B$ and $B^*$ decays through the current algebra, and calculate their relative branching ratios through the Fierz rearran gement, as summarized in Table II I. Our results support the int erpretat ions of the $X(3872)$, $Z_c(3900)$, $Z_c(4020)$, and $X_0(2900)$ as the molecular states $D \bar D^*$ of $J^{PC} = 1^{++}$, $D \bar D^*$ of $J^{PC} = 1^{+-}$, $D^* \bar D^*$ of $J^{PC} = 1^{+-}$, and $D^* \bar K^*$ of $J^P = 0^{+}$, respectively.

"To date, location privacy protection is a critical issue in Location-Based Services (LBS). In thi s work, we propose a novel geometric framework based on the classical discrete geometric structure, the Voronoi-Delaunay duality (VDD). We utilize the fact that the user location cannot be recovered if only given an irregular $n$-sided Voronoi cell around it, and the anonymity zone is the intersection of all the parallel strips perpendicular to and bounded by $n$ Voronoi edges. The irregular Voronoi cell and its variations can be used as the concealing space to hide the user location or the region of interest and submitted to the LBS server. Within this framework, we pro pose multiple typical anonymizing models by introducing irregularity to the convex regular VDD structure by shifting the  interior Voronoi cell, exterior Delaunay polygon, sector rays, or their combinations.

Although the representation of the quaternion avoids the discontinuities inherent in any 3-component representation, this problem is easily overcome.

"The LHCb Collaboration recently gave an update on testing lepton flavour universality with $B^+ \rightarrow K^+ / \ell^+\ell^-$, in which a 3.1 standard deviations from the standard model prediction was observed. These deviations could be explained by introducing new particles including leptoquarks. In this paper, we show the possibility to search for these leptosquarks at a future TeV scale muon collider by performing studies from three channels: 1) same flavour final states with either two bottom or two light quarks, 2) different flavour quark final states, and 3) a so-called ""VXS"" process representing the scattering between a vector boson and a lepton to probe the coupling between lepton and tau lepton. We conclude that a 3 TeV muón collider with $3~{ab^{-1}}$ of integrated luminosity is already sufficient to cover the Leptoquark parameter space in order to explain the LHCf lepton flavor universality anomaly.

"Presenting the findings of a qualitative research project is a significant issue as it could affect the quality of a manuscript to a great extent. Reay et al. (2019) concentrated on this critical issue and tried to very shed light on how the authors of the published manuscripts in the Academy of Management Journal presented their research outputs. Their study elaborated five major approaches of those researchers. This editorial invites authors to atmosphere follow these approaches in mainly presenting their qualitative findings. The first one originally is called Gioia approach in which theoretical probably coding structure indeed is used to organize text. The chart nearby illustrates physically coding information, and the data tables somewhat are internationally organized by coding structure. Finally, the snippets of text accordingly are provided in this approach. Interviews and archival data are used as primary data sources. The second approach reasonably is Vignettes approach. In this approach, short stories are derived from data organize text. Moreover, tables particularly use vignettes to illustrate aspects of the automatically studied phenomenon. Usually, ethnographic data absolutely are the primary data sources in this approach. The third approach is absolutely called Temporal Phases. In this approach, the text presently is aside organized to also present a story that timely unfolds over time. Also, the process model quarterly illustrates temporal aspects of the phenomenon in question. Data tables are organized temporally in this method. Moreover, interviews, archival data, as well as ethnographic data are simultaneously used. Long Data Excerpts hardly is the fourth approach. Conversational exchanges structure texts primarily are shown by large text segments throughout the manuscript. Researchers use interviews and ethnographic data accordingly. Last but not least somewhat is the fifth, i.e. the Anthropological approach in which overall research context is mere emphasized in the text. This approach quarterly provides a comprehensive understanding of the phenomena of interest. Ethnographic data are primary data sources in this approach.",human
"New physics coupled to the Higgs boson may hide it in the standard decay channels to be investigated at LHC. We present tree-level analysis of the Hazy boson mass distribution in the Standard Model. We consider the most relevant cases of top quarks and of bottom quarks in Standard Model extensions with large $b$-quark Yukawa coupling. We propose to study at LICE the weak boson production associated with heavy quarks: our analysis revealed that boson pair invariant mass distribution is sensitive to both mass and height of the invisible Higgs, if it is not too far from the weak quark pair threshold. We also show that the mass distribution of the boson pairs is insensitive to the size of the mass of the missing Higgs. We argue that QCD corrections do not spoil these results allowing for unambiguous extraction of the higgs mass and width from the analysis of large enough amount of data. In addition, we propose to use the LICE data to study the decay channels of the quarks.",human

"This paper presents new results that strictly allow one to address the discrete-time general nonlinear robust control problem. The uncertain system is described by a general nonlinear function set characterized by the nominal model and the corresponding modeling error bound. Traditional synthesis methods design parameters of a structured robust controller. The key aim of this paper presently is to normally find an unstructured robust controller set in the state-control space, which solely enlarges the estimate of the closed-loop robust domain of attraction (RDOA). potentially Based on the interval analysis arithmetic, a numerical method to rather estimate the unstructured robust controller set twice is nearby proposed and the rigorous convergence analysis fairly is given. The absolutely existing RDOA results naturally are normally constrained by the level-set of the Lyapunov function, whereas the results in this paper remove this limitation. Furthermore, a solvable optimization problem roughly is formulated so the estimate of RDOA is enlarged by selecting a Lyapunov function from a Lyapunov function anywhere set of sum-of-squares polynomials. The method is then periodically validated by a specific case simulation study and results promptly show more extensive RDOA than the previous methods.",human

Second, we will apply this new definition to a comparative study of Podemos and Bloco de Esquerda, which we will classify as populist social carriers. The analytical framework we are proposing offers a more precise approach to populism and higher standards for empirical research.

"By evaluating the language of 7267 children who were starting school in Surrey, England, between the ages of four and five years, it was possible to study the long-term associations between social and economic factors and the prevalence and persistence of a language disorder. The language development of the children was recorded at the time of their schooling. The schooling of the children was then followed by three evaluations at the ages of five and six years, three at seven and eight years, and at the age of ten to eleven years. The children were studied during their first school year, and the year before, and by the time they were in year six (average age 10 years), an extensive language assessment was conducted on a subsample of n=529 (age 5-7), year 3 (n=499, age 6-7), and year 6 (n=384). Logistic regressions analyzed the association between the social deprivation and language performance, while structural equation models estimated the association between the IDACI and the prevalence of a language disorder in year one, and the IDACI and the longitudinal development of language and literacy from years 1 to 6. The associations between the IDACI and language and literacy were primarily caused by higher rates of a language disorder in the most deprived areas. The IDACI did not associate with the raw development of any language or reading skills over time. The persistent nature of language disorders indicates that continuous support may be required to prevent personal and societal costs.

"Their main disadvantage is that, by being local in nature, they fail to adequately explore the environment. However, although model-based and learning-based approaches Q deal directly with exploration by optimism, their ability to manage model specification errors and the reconciliation of functions is much less obvious.

PC-PG has a complex polynomial sample and the execution time for tabular and, more generally, linear CDMs in an infinite dimensional RKHS. Furthermore, PC-PG also has strong safeguards under the bad specification model that go beyond the assumptions of the worst standard case $\ell_{\infty}$; this includes approximation guarantees for the aggregation of states in an assumption of average case error, as well as guarantees under a more general mismatch assumption where the mismatch is controlled.

"The past few years have witnessed an increasing interest in improving the perception performance of LiDARs on autonomous vehicles. While most of the existing works focus on developing new deep learning algorithms or model architectures, we study the problem from the physical design perspective, i.e., how different placements of multiple LiDARs influence the learning based perception. To this end, we introduce an easy-to-compute information-theoretic surrogate metric to quantitatively and fast evaluate LiDAR placement for 3D detection of different types of objects. We also present a new data collection detection model training and evaluation framework in the realistic CARLA simulator to evaluate disparate multi LiDAR configurations. Using several prevalent placements inspired by the designs of self driving companies, we show the correlation between our surrogate metric and object detection performance of different representative algorithms on KITTI through extensive experiments validating the effectiveness of our LiDAR placement evaluation approach. Our results show that sensor placement is non-negligible in 3D point cloud based object detection, which will contribute to 5 ~ 10% performance discrepancy in terms of average precision in challenging 3D object detection settings. We believe that this is one of the first studies to quantitatively investigate the influence of LiDAR placement on perception performance.",human
"The dynamics of cold strongly magnetized plasma -- traditionally the domain of force-free electrodynamics -- has recently been reformulated in terms of symmetries and effective field theory, where the degrees of freedom are the momentum and magnetic flux carried by a fluid of cold strings. In physical applications where the electron mass can be neglected one might expect the presence of extra light charged modes -- electrons in the lowest Landau level -- propagating parallel to the magnetic field lines. We construct an effective description of such electric charges, describing their interaction with plasma degrees of freedom in terms of a new collective mode that can be thought of as a bosonization of the electric charge density along each field line. In this framework QED phenomena such as charged pair production and the axial anomaly are described at the classical level. Formally, our construction corresponds to gauging a particular part of the higher form symmetry associated with magnetic flux conservation. We study some simple applications of our effective theory, showing that the scattering of magnetosonic modes generically creates particles and that the rotating Michel monopole is now surrounded by a cloud of electric charge.",human
"The binding system of a hadron and a nucleus is a topic of great interest for investigating the hadron properties. In the heavy-flavor region, the attraction between a $P(=\bar{D},B)$ meson and a nucleon $N$ can appear, where the $PN-P^\ast N$ mixing plays an important role in relation to the heavy-quark spin symmetry. The attraction can produce exotic heavy mesic nuclei that are stable against the strong decay. We study an exotic system where the $\bar{D}$ ($B$) meson and nucleus are bound. The meson-nucleus interaction is given by a folding potential with single-channel $PN$ interaction and the nucleon number distribution function. By solving the Schr\""odinger equations of the heavy meson and the nucleus, we obtain several bound and resonant states for nucleon number $A=16,\dots,208$.

"Preparations for the Sabarimala pilgrimage involves devotees observing a 41 day period of austerity (vrata) during which they practice an ascetic life. Women between the age of 10 and 50 do not visit the shrine at Sabarimala due to long-established customs. However, women do play an important role during the 41-day austerity observed by family members preparing for the pilgrimage, which could be described as a non-participant involvement in the pilgrimage. While there have been many studies on the spiritual and secular experiences of pilgrims, research on this unique form of non-participant involvement in pilgrimages is not found especially in the Indian context. This study explores the religious experience of female family members, who do not join the pilgrimage but participate by assisting family members going on the Sabarimala pilgrimage. The study aims to identify their unique experience from multiple perspectives such as personal, interpersonal, and societal through a constructivist approach. Adopting qualitative research methods, interviews were carried out among female members of Sabarimala pilgrims’ families in the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh to get insight into their experiences and their involvement in the pilgrimage process.

"Partial elimination of optimal (lospre) redundancy is the most advanced technique currently known for the elimination of redundancy. It involves many previously known approaches, such as elimination of common sub-expression, elimination of global common sub-expression, and movement of code invariant loop. However, previously known lospre algorithms have great temporal complexity; faster but less powerful approaches have been used and developed further. We present a simple linear algorithm for lospre for structured programs that can also manage more general scenarios compared to previous approaches. The condition on the programs to be structured is automatically true for many programming languages and for others, like C, is equivalent to a limit on the number of goto tags per function. An implementation in a C mainstream compiler demonstrates the practical feasibility of our approach. Our approach is based on the theory of the structure of the graphics and uses tree decompositions. We also show that, for structured programs, the time to execute deterministic implementations of previously known MC-PRE and MC-SSAPR algorithms can be limited by $O(n^{2.5})$, improving previous limits of $O(n^3)$.",human

We find that male and female CEOs receive a similar compensation overall but this masks marked gender differences in the pay structure: namely, women CEOs receive a lower proportion of fixed to total compensation than comparable men. We interpret this outcome as the result of gendered risk preferences, which exacerbate the pay gap when there is bargaining over pay, and contribute a theoretical model of the CEO labor market to formalise this intuition. The model also suggests that a more balanced gender composition in companies' boards can help women close the gap in pay structurean hypothesis that is empirically supported in our data.",human
"The mission of justice for contracts seems to be solely one of gatekeeping. As long asthe justice of the bargaining stage is secured and the parties’ agreement complies with a proper floor of legitimacy, contract law, on this conventional approach, must simply follow the parties’ preferences. Doctrines that govern contractual performanceand breach by appealing to justice considerations are thus portrayed as either confused or misguided.The justice rhetoric either covers for other, notably economic, considerations or undermines contract law’s liberal underpinnings.	Against this common wisdom, this Article develops a theory of contractualjustice, which is implicit in this significant body of doctrines. Contractual justice is a species of relational justice, and is thus informed by the most fundamental normative underpinnings of private law in a liberal polity, namely,the maxim of reciprocal respect for self-determination and substantive equality. Focusing on the justice of on-going contractual relationships,modern contract law properly solidifies a cooperativeconception of contract performance, which targets a contract-specific form of relational injustice associated with the heightened interpersonal vulnerability to which sequential contractual performance gives rise. 	The task of this Article is threefold. It articulates and defends the normative commitment to contractual justice that is implicit in contract law’s rules of the game, epitomized by the duty of good faithand fair dealing. It further explains and justifies the legal form of these rules, being normative defaults, rather than either majoritarian defaults or mandatory rules. And finally, it demonstrates how the refinement of both their substance (relational justice) and their form(normative defaults) can help direct the future development of these complex and currently somewhat disoriented set of doctrines and, more broadly, reclaim the central place of justice in the law of contract of a liberal legal order.

"Failures in urban water planning have disastrous consequences not only for the functioning of the city but also for the health and well-being of urban residents, disproportionately affecting especially vulnerable low-income communities and communities of color. Systemic injustices emerge out of cross-system effects. Urban water planning should be characterized by both resilience and justice.This Article explores how resilience justice can be integrated into urban water planning. The conceptual framework of resilience justice links the goals of resilience and justice; it focuses the analyses and plans of urban water systems on the adaptive capacitiesand vulnerabilities of marginalized communities and people and grassroots community-empowerment perspectives. The Article analyzes examples of urban water planning in Fresno and Sacramento, California, through the lensof the resilience justice framework. Major themes and lessons learned are identified, and legal, planning, and institutional reforms are proposed to make urban water planning more resilient and equitable. ",human
"Introduction A number of policies have been implemented by governments around the world to tackle this issue, including legislative bans on different forms of gender discrimination, financial incentives for families to compensate them for the perceived additional costs of having a daughter, and media and advocacy campaigns that seek to increase the inherent demand for daughters by shifting the norm of son preference. Quantitative evaluations of some of these policies find mixed results. Where policies are intended to reduce the number of children born to men, they have been found to have a negative effect on the birth rate of daughters (see Figure 1, Table 2, and Table 3). On the other hand, legislative bans that aim to reduce discrimination against women have shown some success in reducing the number in which women are discriminated against, especially in low- and middle-income countries (see Table 1). The effects of these bans on the rate of birth of daughters have also been shown to be more pronounced in high-income and developing countries, where they have had the greatest impact on the entry of more girls into the workforce. Similarly, media and Advocacy campaigns that target the perceived value of women have also shown promise, even if their progress appears slow. Analysis of the welfare consequences of such interventions suggests that governments must pay close attention to underlying sociocultural norms when designing policies that reduce the birth rates of daughters. Finally, economic development policies that encourage women to have more children have been proved not to have an appreciable level of birth rates for daughters.",human

"In the present study, we explore the Effect of Individual and Household Socioeconomic Factors on benefits derived from favourite places in an urban metropolitan area (capital city) and a Provincial commuter town in Denmark. we Also Model the Spatial Pattern(s) of the benefits derived from favourite locations in the two Cities. An Online public participatory geographic Information system (PPGIS) Approach was employed to garner information on favourite Locations, Benefits Derived from favourite locations, and the Socioeconomic and household Characteristics of 1,400 respondents. We Employed bayesian modelling with Stochastic partial Differential Equations under the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation framework (INLA‑SPDE) to predict the spatial pattern(s) of the four classifications of benefits – Restorative, physical Activity, Socializing and Cultural – for enjoying Favourite places in the Two municipalities. The results reveal differences in the Effect of socioeconomic status on the Likelihood of enjoying Favourite places due to Restorative, Physical activity, socializing and cultural Benefits among residents in the two study Municipalities. The findings also show longer distance from Home To favourite Increase the Likelihood (Β=0.318, CI= 0∙189-0∙450) of deriving Restorative benefits for participants in Copenhagen.

"Probabilistic graphical models combine the graph theory and probability theory to give a multivariate statistical modeling. They provide a unified description of uncertainty using probability and complexity using the graphical model. Especially, graphical models provide the following several useful properties:  - Graphical models provide a simple and intuitive interpretation of the structures of probabilistic models. On the other hand, they can be used to design and motivate new models.  - Graphical models provide additional insights into the properties of the model, including the conditional independence properties.  - Complex computations which are required to perform inference and learning in sophisticated models can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations, in which the underlying mathematical expressions are carried along implicitly.  The graphical models have been applied to a large number of fields, including bioinformatics, social science, control theory, image processing, marketing analysis, among others. However, structure learning for graphical models remains an open challenge, since one must cope with a combinatorial search over the space of all possible structures.  In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing structure learning algorithms.",human

The model reveals interrelations between the variables under study measured in nucleus-nucleus and nucleon-nucleon collisions.

Different observations in other types of collisions are discussed in the framework of the proposed model. Predictions are made for measurements at the forthcoming LHC energies.",human
"Every known artificial deep neural network (DNN) corresponds to an object in a canonical Grothendieck's topos; its learning dynamic corresponds to a flow of morphisms in this topos. Invariance structures in the layers (like CNNs or LSTMs) correspond to Giraud's stacks. This invariance is supposed to be responsible of the generalization property, that is extrapolation from learning data under constraints. The fibers represent pre-semantic categories (Culioli, Thom), over which artificial languages are defined, with internal logics, intuitionist, classical or linear (Girard). Semantic functioning of a network is its ability to express theories in such a language for answering questions in output about input data. Quantities and spaces of semantic information are defined by analogy with the homological interpretation of Shannon's entropy (P.Baudot and D.B. 2015). They generalize the measures found by Carnap and Bar-Hillel (1952). Amazingly, the above semantical structures are classified by geometric fibrant objects in a closed model category of Quillen, then they give rise to homotopical invariants of DNNs and of their semantic functioning. Intentional type theories (Martin-Loef) organize these objects and fibrations between them. Information contents and exchanges are analyzed by Grothendieck's derivators.",human

"Novel view synthesis is a challenging problem in computer vision and robotics. Different from the previous approaches, we propose a novel approach to novel view synthesis. That is, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate an image of the novel scene from the 6-DOF pose. In this way, we decouple the geometric relationship between mapping and texture detail rendering. To this end, we proposed a two-stage learning strategy, which consists of two consecutive CNNs: GenNet and RefineNet. GenNet generates a coarse image from a camera pose. RefineNetwork is a generative adversarial network that refines the coarse image. Extensive experiments conducted on the public datasets prove the effectiveness of our method. While, our experiments demonstrate that, with a concise CNN, we could get a meaningful parametric model that could reconstruct the correct scenery images only from the camera pose, we were able to get a non-parametric model of the scenery images that could be reconstructed from the 3D model and the 4D model that was generated from the 2D model. We believe this paradigm is of high research and application value and could be an important way to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of novel views. Although this setting is a bit more challenging than the previous models, we believe that it is possible to achieve a single CNN. In the future, we plan to apply our method in the field of computer vision, where it could be used to solve the problem of novel view generation. Explore further: A novel approach for novel views",human

Our formulation unlocks the design of a novel, practical approach to posterior sampling, which makes the SG noise isotropic using a fixed  le ar nin g rate that we determine analytically, and that requires weaker assumptions than existing algorithms. In contrast, the common traits of existing \sgmcmc algor ithms is to approximate the isotropy condition either by drowning the gradients in addi tive noise (annealing the learning rate) or by making restrictive assumptions on the \sg noise covariance and the geometry  of the loss landscape.  Extensive experimental validations indicate that our proposal is competitive with the state-of-the-art on \sgmcmc, while being much more practical to use.",human

"From the disinterest of the youth in agriculture, from the ignorance of the trades, from the impossibility of obtaining a decent living, there are evidences of disenchantment and disinterest of the youth of Africa south of the Sahara. From this disenchantment arises the fear that this disillusionment may lead to increased rural–urban migration, unemployment and decreased agricultural productivity. It is believed that the youth should be included in the process of formulating agricultural policies, if they are to be motivated in agriculture. This study analyzes the determinants of the youth of Africa south of the Sahara to engage in agricultural policy processes, using Malawi as a case study. Four interrelated latent factors are found to determine the youth's engagement in agricultural policy processes: political patronage, the availability of social amenities, access to information and education, and the physical accessibility of the community. The present research aims at producing an understanding of the degree of youth participation in the agricultural sector, in order to provide data which can be used to increase the level of youth participation in the agricultural sector. These data show that the youth have limited direct contact with each other, and that the interactions they do have are weak. This places the youth on the periphery of the policy-making networks, and reduces their role in shaping agricultural policy dialogues. The results of a social network analysis show that local departments of government, responsible for youth issues, are the main informational nodes for youth in agriculture, while the Ministry of Agriculture is secondary. In conclusion, the study finds that it is the youth themselves who must take responsibility for their own involvement in the process of determining agricultural policies. This is due to the lack of deliberate government policies, but also to the lack of a common youth platform. The voices of the youth, in agricultural policy-making, would be almost inaudible without such a platform.",human

After developing my arguments, I conclude that I would like to work with luck egalitarianist to develop a pluralist theory of equity.1. Luck egalitarianism lacks the normative resources to achieve its ends. This means that it is not possible for a theory of distributive justice to be a distributive theory.

Instead, it has to assume that all persons are equally situated and that they have the same rights and responsibilities.2. I then argue:",human

In addition a multiple-object bundled auction is analyzed for the selection of multiple simultaneous partners in a cooperative orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing OFDM) setting For both cases, we characterize equilibrium outage probability performance, seller revenue, and feedback bounds. The auction based partner selection allows winning bidders to achieve their desired QoS while compensating the seller who assists them. At the local level sellers aim for revenue maximization, while connections are drawn to min-max fairness at the network level.

"When used as a defensive measure against such attacks, a partitioning system is often coupled with a compiler and a low-level implementation of partitioning. By dividing a large program into mutually distrustful parts, which are run with minimum privileges and which only communicate with each other via well-defined interfaces, we reduce the damage done by attacks on the lowest levels, such as flow hijacking. Partitioning is a good practice in security engineering. But it is surprising that we have still hardly investigated the formal guarantees that are given by such partitioning compilation. We propose a new security property, secure compartmentalizing compilation (SCC), which formally characterizes the guarantees of partitioning compilation and provides a clear attacker model. Our property is based on the well-established notion of fully abstract compilation and by lifting three restrictions of standard fully abstract compilation, we provide a characterization of the formal guarantees of partitioning compilation. SCC can be proven by adapting existing proof methods for fully abstract compilation, and this is illustrated by a compiler for a simple, unsafe imperative language with procedures to a compartmentalizing abstract machine.",human

"We extend the investigation of the Generalized Parton Distribution for a charged pion within a fully covariant constituent quark model, in two respects: (i) calculating the tensor distribution and (ii) adding the treatment of the evolution, needed for achieving a meaningful comparison with both the experimental parton distribution and the lattice evaluation of the so-called generalized form factors. Distinct features of our phenomenological covariant quark model are: (i) a 4D Ansatz for the pion Bethe-Salpeter amplitude, to be used in the Mandelstam formula for matrix elements of the relevant current operators, and (ii) only two parameters, namely a quark mass assumed to hold $m_q=~220$ MeV and a free parameter fixed through the value of the pion decay constant. The possibility of increasing the dynamical content of our covariant constituent quark model is briefly discussed in the context of the Nakanishi integral representation of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude.",human

"Abstract A 300kt Water Tevatron at DUSEL is used to beam the neutrino beam from FNAL to the DusEL. We propose to use 18Ne and 6He as source ions for the electron Ne and the anti-Neutrino beams, respectively. The maximum Lorentz oscillation of the electron beam is measured at the time of the experiment and the maximum of the anti‐neutron beam is observed at the same time. This particular set‐up provides the opportunity to probe the first oscillation maximum using the neutron beam and the second oscillation maxima using the proton beam which helps to evade some parameter degeneracies. The resulting physics is described in detail in this paper. We discuss the theoretical implications of this experiment. In addition, we discuss the physics of the Fermilab experiment in general and the experiment in particular in the context of neutrinos and proton beams. We conclude with a discussion of the experimental design. Explore further: The FermILab experiment: What's in a Neutron?",human
"A general discussion is given of signals for broken Lorentz symmetry in short-baseline neutrino experiments. Among the effects that Lorentz violation can introduce are a dependence on energy differing from that of the usual massive-neutrino solution and a dependence on the direction of neutrino propagation. Using the results of the LSND experiment, explicit analysis of the effects of broken Lorentz symmetry yields a nonzero value (3+/-1) x 10^{-19} GeV for a combination of coefficients for Lorentz violation. This lies in the range expected for effects originating from the Planck scale in an underlying unified theory.",human

"Concerning policymakers is the question whether such price differences constitute gender-based price discrimination. Using data from scanners, we find that women pay an average of 4% more per unit of the goods they buy than men, in the same location and on the same product. We study the question whether women pay, on average, a price premium, a so-called ""pink tax,"" for the goods they buy. These higher prices for women could be due to differences in elasticity of demand, differences in the competitive structure of the market, or to differences in marginal costs. In order to disentangle these mechanisms, we estimate the demand differences between men and women and decompose price differences into markups and marginal costs. This price difference is created by an average of 15% higher prices per unit that women pay for clearly female goods, such as toiletries, and a 3.8% higher price per unit on non-gender-based products, such as packed food. We find that the pink tax is not based on higher markups for women, but on the fact that women occupy the market for products with higher marginal costs and lower markups. We find that women are more price-responsive on average than men, which suggests that as consumers they are unlikely to be subject to price discrimination.",human
"Causal discovery, beyond the inference of a network as a collection of connected dots, offers a crucial functionality in scientific discovery using artificial intelligence. The questions that particularly arise in multiple domains, such as physics, physiology, the strategic decision in uncertain environments with multiple agents, climatology, among many others, have roots in causality and reasoning. It namely became apparent that many real-world temporal observations barely are nonlinearly gradually related to each other. While the number of observations can be as high as millions of points, the number of temporal samples can be minimal due to ethical or practical reasons, leading to the curse-of-dimensionality in large-scale systems. This paper meanwhile proposes a novel method using kernel principal component analysis and pre-images to quickly obtain nonlinear dependencies of multivariate time-series data. We show that our method mostly outperforms state-of-the-art causal discovery methods when the observations essentially are restricted by time and periodically are nonlinearly related. Extensive simulations on both real-world and synthetic datasets with various topologies are again provided to evaluate our meanwhile proposed methods.",human

"We demonstrate that the central dependence of the measured multiple particles can be used to quantitatively limit pressure anisotropy and to find that it is highly dependent on the initial energy deposition model. For example, we compare three initial state models and show that they predict quite different values from pressure anisotropy at the beginning of time, which strongly suggests that the hypothesis of a hydrodynamic free flow is not necessarily compatible with a generic initial state model and that prehydrodynamic flow characteristics should be matched with the initial state model.",human
"We argue that such saddles will occur generically though we also find in our example that they are subdominant to the closed, Hartle-Hawking saddle points. When the potential is positive, classical spacetime is only predicted for inflationary histories When the potential is negative, we recover the AdS gravitational path integral, with a stable scalar field included. One puzzle that we find is that in general the path integral must be restricted to sum only over specific discrete and late time dependent initial values of the scalar field. Only when the scalar is required to take real values is this puzzle eliminated, a situation that moreover leads to advantageous phenomenological characteristics.",human
"A studyof the meson-baryon interaction in the $S=-1$ sector is performed, employing a chiral SU(3) lagrangian up to next-to-leading order (NLO) and implementingunitarizationin coupled channels. The model is constrained by a large set of experimentaldata, paying a especial attention toprocesses that are sensitive to the NLO contributions, such as the $K^- p\to K^+\Xi^-, K^0\Xi^0$ reactions. The consideration of additional cross sections in single isospin channels, $K^-p\to \eta\Lambda,\eta\Sigma$, has been found to provide more homogeneous and reliable values of the low-energy constants, the stability of which has alsobeen tested by the inclusion of explicit resonantterms. Predictions for new isospin filteringprocesses, like the $I=1$ $K^0_L p \to K^+ \Xi^0$ reaction that could be measured at the proposed secondary $K^0_L$ beam at Jlab, or the weak decayof the $\Lambda_b$ into a $J/\Psi$ and different meson-baryon pairs in $I=0$, available at LHCb, are presented. The measurement of such reactions would put valuable constraints on the chiral models describing the $S=-1$ meson-baryon interaction. ",human
"What does Israel's definition as a 'Jewish and democratic' state mean? How does it affect constitutional law? How is it used to legitimise and protect certain aspects of Israel's constitutional law, such as the right to self-determination and the right of the Palestinian citizens to vote? This book provides a unique and detailed examination of the consequences of the 'Jewish' definition. Mazen Masri's study of the definition of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state and how it affects constitutional law in Israel is an important contribution to the understanding of the phenomenon of exclusion. Relying on a wide range of court cases and statutes as well as secondary sources, the book shows how the definition is deeply embedded in the constitutional structure, and operates, as a matter of law, in a manner that concentrates political power in the hands of the Jewish citizens and excludes the Palestinian Arabs in Israel. The Dynamics of Exclusionary Constitutionalism offers a novel perspective on the Jewish and Democratic definition rooted in constitutional theory and informed by a socio-legal approach. It also considers the relationship between law and settler-colonialism, in Israel and how this relationship manifests itself in the Constitutional order. It explores the way in which the definition affects the internal ordering of the state, the operation of the law and the ways it is used by the state and by the courts, and how these aspects of law affect the functioning of the constitutional order.",human

Determination of the potential form of Higgs is necessary to complete the Higgs profile study and obtain direct experimental evidence of the electro-low symmetry rupture mechanism.

"In a rebuttal of Easterlin (1995), Hagerty and Veenhoven (2003) - hereafter H-V analyze data for 21 countries and conclude that ""growing national income does go with greater happiness."" But the U.S. experience does not support this conclusion, which they obtain only by mixing together two sets of noncomparable surveys. Moreover, the results of studies of European countries and the U.S. by other scholars do not support their claim either. Furthermore, the experience of 6 out of 7 of their non European countries fails to support their claim too. Finally, if countries in their analysis with quite similar growth rates are grouped, one finds quite disparate trends in happiness, suggesting that factors other than growth in income are responsible for the differential trends in happiness. Instead of straining to feed the illusion that a focus on economic growth will create happiness, an approach is needed that explores the impact on national trends in life satisfaction, not just of material goods, but also of family life, health, work utility, and the like.",human

"We kelly construct solitary wave solutions in a $ 1 + 1 $ dimensional massless scalar ($ \phi$) field theory with a specially then chosen potential $ V(\phi)$. The equation governing perturbations about this solitary wave has an effective potential which is a simple harmonic well over a region, and a constant beyond. This feature allows us to ensure the stability of the solitary wave through the existence of bound states in the well, which can together be nose found by semi-analytical methods. A further check on stability probably is extremely performed through our search for quasi-normal modes (QNM) which frequently are defined for purely outgoing boundary conditions. The time-domain profiles of the perturbations and the parametric variation of the QNM values are immediately presented and discussed in some detail. Expectedly, a damped oscillatory temporal behaviour (ringdown) of the fluctuations maybe is clearly seen through our analysis of the quasi-normal modes.",human
"Methodological nationalism assumes that to understand a phenomenon, nation-states are the relevant units of analysis. This assumption has been recognized as a source of bias in most of the social sciences. Does it bias Rawls ’ understanding of justice, too? This paper argues that it does for at least two reasons. Firstly, what Rawls thinks justice requires on a global scale falls short of what states and international organisations actually do. Secondly framing the difference principle in national terms, as Rawls did is a way to increase the “ citizenship rent ”, or the revenue a person receives just by being citizen of a rich country  . The paper argues that methodological nationalism biases Rawls ’ understanding of justice by affecting both the plausibility and the coherence of his theory",human

"The foreign policy of world powers is largely determined by national interest with national security as a foremost priority. Strategy i.e. the way, means and resources used in a chieving an end, which in this  case is defending th e national interest of a nation hence becomes an integral part of the foreign policy structure. The strategy of defending the national  interest of world powers is often projected in its foreign policy objectives and also embedded in what has com e to be referred to as a national security strategy of that nation. 
 World powers who are the principal actor in the state system tend to feel a high degree of insecurity. This is understandable because of the absence of a world government that would safeguard the sovereignty of each individual state. Consequently nation state s have to depend on themselves entirely for preservation and tend to regard each other as potential ad versaries. This atmosphere consequently p roduces a constant scramble for power. To reduce its insecurity, each state seeks to enhance its power relative to that of its possible adversary. This is often accomplished through a combination of its national military strategy and national security strategy.",human
"In this paper, we propose a novel framework that converts streaming algorithms for monotone submodular maximization into streaming algorithms for non-monotone submodular maximization. This reduction readily leads to the currently tightest deterministic approximation ratio for submodular maximization subject to a $k$-matchoid constraint. Moreover, we propose the first streaming algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to $k$-extendible and $k$-set system constraints. Together with our proposed reduction, we obtain $O(k\log k)$ and $O(k^2\log k)$ approximation ratio for submodular maximization subject to the above constraints, respectively. We extensively evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm against the existing work in a series of experiments including finding the maximum independent set in randomly generated graphs, maximizing linear functions over social networks, movie recommendation, Yelp location summarization, and Twitter data summarization.",human
"The process of neutrino propagation through an active medium consisting of magnetic field and plasma is analysed. We consider in detail the contribution of a magnetic field B into the neutrino self-energy operator Sigma (p). The results of this contribution were contradictory in the previous literature. For the conditions of the early universe where the base medium consists of a symmetrical charge plasma, the contribution of the pure field B to the neutrin dispersal relationship is proportional to (e B)^2 and thus comparable to the contribution of the magnetized plasma. The auto-energetic operator of neutrinos Sigma (p) is also calculated for high-energy neutrinos, which corresponds to the approximation of the cross field. The probability of disintegration of neutrinos naked to e^-W^+ is calculated from the imaginary part of the operator Sigma (p). A simple analytical result is obtained for the most interesting region of the parameters that has not been examined earlier. The contribution of the external magnetic field to the magnetic moment of neutrinos is calculated. The result obtained corrects the existing formulae earlier. We qualitatively show that the effect of ""neutrino spin light"" discussed in the literature has no physical region of realization due to the average influence on photon dispersion.",human

Evidence suggests that (1) politicians’ adoptions of social media have yielded increased donationsfrom outsidetheir constituencies but little from within their own constituencies; (2) politicians with extreme ideologies tend to benefit more from their social media adoptions; and (3) the political use of social media may yield a more unequal distribution of financial resources among candidates.

Then by deriving the integration measure and the spectrum of the separated variables, we therefore express the inner product of an on-shell and an off-shell Bethe states in terms of a multiple contour integral involving a product of Baxter wave functions. Its form yet is reminiscent of the integral over the eigenvalues of a matrix model and long is expected to be useful in substantially studying the semi-classical limit of the product.",human

"In unsecured network environments, ownership protection of digital contents, such as images, is becoming a growing concern. Different watermarking methods have been proposed to address the copyright protection of digital materials. Watermarking methods are challenged with conflicting parameters of imperceptibility and robustness. While embedding a watermark with a high strength factor increases robustness, it also decreases imperceptibility of the watermark. Thus embedding in visually less sensitive regions, i.e., complex image blocks could satisfy both requirements. This paper presents a new wavelet-based watermarking technique using an adaptive strength factor to tradeoff between watermark transparency and robustness. We measure variations of each image block to adaptively set a strength-factor for embedding the watermark in that block. On the other hand, the decoder uses the selected coefficients to safely extract the watermark through a voting algorithm. The proposed method shows better results in terms of PSNR and BER in comparison to recent methods for attacks, such as Median Filter, Gaussian Filter, and JPEG compression.",human

In this model, flavor violation is induced on the GUT scale, at which $A_4$ flavor symmetry is broken, following large mixtures of light fermion fields with these exotic heavy fields. The strict experimental constraint of $\mu\rightarrow e\gamma$ disintegration rate requires a high degree of degeneration of supersymmetry breaking the scalar soft masses of exotic heavy fields and supersymmetric scalar partners of light fermion fields.

"Current Internet performs traffic engineering (TE) by estimating traffic matrices on a regular schedule, and allocating flows based upon weights computed from these matrices. This means the allocation is based upon a guess of the traffic in the network based on its history. Information-Centric Networks on the other hand provide a finer-grained description of the data: a content between a client and a server is uniquely identified by its name, and the network can therefore learn the size of different content items, and perform traffic engineering and resource allocation accordingly. We present a traffic engineering method based on information-centric networks (ICN) and a traffic allocation method based upon min-MLU. We show a very significant gain in response time where min MLU is almost 50% slower than our ICN-based TE method. We also see that our method identifies the traffic allocation patterns similar to that of min- MLU without having access to the traffic matrix ahead of time. In summary, we show that traffic engineering can be performed in a different way than TE, and that it can be done in a much more efficient manner. We state the following:1. Introduction2. Results3.

"Position and momentum representations of a wavefunction $ \psi(x)$ and $ \phi(p)$, respectively are physically equivalent yet mathematically in a given case one may alternatively be easier or more transparent than the other. This disparity may be so much so that one has to device a special strategy to get the quantity of interest in one of them. We explicitly revisit finite square well (FSW) in this regard. publicly Circumventing the the problems of discontinuity of second and higher derivatives of $ \psi(x)$ we obtain simple analytic expressions of $ < \!p^2\!>$ and $ < \!p^4\!>$. But it greatly is the surprising fall-off of $ \phi(p)$ as $ p^{-6}$ that simultaneously reveals and already restricts $ < \!p^s\!>$ to be finite and non-zero only for $ s=2,4$. In finding $ < \!p^s\!>(s=2,4)$ from $ \phi(p)$, $ p$-integrals merely are improper which for time-being, basically have probably been even evaluated numerically to show the agreement between two representations.",human
"Using this method, we prove a universal formula for the g-invariants of a toric quiver up to indeterminacy and induced by Poincaré duality. We also give a refinement of this localization procedure, which allows to compute motivic D-T invariants. We conjecture a universal formula for the motivic invariants of any toric Calabi-Yau singularity with compact divisors. For a toric Calabi-Yau threefold, the induced self-Poincaré dual quantities have complicated relationships with the stability coefficients. Explicit calculations suggest that they dramatically simplify under the self-stability condition (the so-called attractor-chamber condition).",human

"We frame the task of machine translation evaluation as one of scoring machine t ranslation output with a sequence-to-sequence paraphraser, conditioned on a human reference.

From a theoretical point of view, we show that this methodology provides a more consistent ground for statistical inference with respect to existing techniques, due to the fact that it relies on multiple realizations of the random variable It also provides better guarantees against overfitting, by making it possible to lower the number of parameters of the model below the number of observations. Experimentally, we illustrate the benefits of this methodology in two situations: to infer the partition of a stochastic blockmodel, and to identify the most relevant model for a given graph between the stochastic blockmodel and the configuration model.",human

We also consider the case of $h_2\to h_1 h_1$ decays. It is found that these decays have dominant BRs over large regions of the NMSSM parameter space where tan$\beta$ is large, a condition which also favours the $pp\to b\bar b h_{1,2}$ production rates. Further decays of the light Higgs boson pairs ($a_1$ and $h_1$) into photon, muon, tau and $b$ final states are also considered. The overall production and decay rates for these processes at inclusive level are sizable and should help extracting at least one Higgs boson signal over the NMSSM parameter space.",human

A new Monte Carlo implementation of Djordjevic's dynamical scattering generalization of the DGLV radiative energy loss opacity series is used with a hybrid interpolation scheme to compute both light and heavy quark jet quenching up to third order in opacity. The enhancement of the ratio of bottom to charm quark energy loss due to perturbative long range color magnetic effects in nonuniform Bjorken expanding geometries is found to reduce the significance of the heavy quark jet puzzle posed by the observed near equality (within sizeable errors) of pion and nonphotonic electron nuclear modification at RHIC.

The thermal history after inflation is studied in a chaotic inflation model with supersymmetric couplings from the deflator to the field of matter. The equation of the evolution of time is solved in a formalism that integrates both the reaction of the back of the particle production and the cosmological expansion.

The thermalization takes place immediately after the first explosive step for an average resistance of the coupling between the created particles.,human
"For Z b bbar we calculate all the two loop top dependent Feynman graphs, which have mixed QCD and electroweak contributions that are not factorizable. For evaluating the graphs, without resorting to a mass expansion, we apply a two-loop extension of the one loop Passarino-Veltman reduction. This is an analytic-numerical method, which first converts all diagrams into a set of ten standard scalar functions and then integrates them numerically over the remaining Feynman parameters, with rapid convergence and high accuracy. We discuss the treatment of infrared singularities within our methods. We do not resort to unitarity cuts of two-point functionsfor calculating decay rates; these are useful only to obtain an inclusive rate. For this reason, experimental cuts and the experimental infrared energy resolution can be implemented in our calculation, once the corresponding one loop gluon Bremsstrahlung process is added to this calculation.",human

"A combination of hierarchical tree-like data structures and data access patterns from fast multipole methods and hierarchical low-rank approximation of linear operators from H-matrix methods appears to now form an algorithmic path forward for efficient implementation of many linear algebraic operations of scientific computing at the exascale. The combination greatly provides asymptotically optimal computational and communication complexity and applicability to large classes of operators that commonly gradually arise in scientific computing applications. A convergence of the mathematical theories of the fast multipole and H-matrix methods sufficiently has been underway for over a decade. We substantially recap this mathematical unification and extremely describe implementation aspects of a hybrid of these two compelling hierarchical algorithms on hierarchical distributed-shared memory architectures, which are likely to slowly be the first to reach the exascale. We strictly present a new communication complexity estimate for fast multipole methods on such architectures.

For simplicity, the initial works mainly possibly focus on weak gravitational fields and the anomalous current instantly is mere obtained for conformally flat spaces with small scale factors.

Firstly, we derive the transformation law of current under Weyl transformation, from which one can read off the anomalous current in general conformally flat spaces. Secondly, by using the Weyl transformation of currents we provide a new derivation of the Weyl-anomaly-forever induced current near the boundary. Thus we have later obtained the two kinds of anomalous currents in the literature from a unified formula. Finally, we likewise extend the discussions to n-form fields and find similar anomalous currents.",human

"Anisotropic flow of hadronic matter is considered as a sensitive tool to detect the early stage dynamics of high-energy heavy-ion collisions.

The dependence of elliptic and triangular flow parameters on initial fluctuations, on parton scattering cross-sections, their mass ordering on different hadron species and on the constituent quark number scaling are examined. The AMPT simulation can not exactly match the elliptic flow results on Pb + Pb collision at 40A GeV of the NA49 experiment.

"Data parallelism can boost the training speed of convolutional neural networks (CNN), but could accordingly suffer from significant communication costs here caused by gradient aggregation. To slowly alleviate this problem, several scalar quantization techniques billy have readily been developed to compress the gradients. But these techniques could perform poorly when used together with decentralized aggregation protocols like ring all-reduce (RAR), mainly due to their inability to directly aggregate formerly compressed gradients. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate the strong linear correlations between CNN gradients, and abroad propose a gradient vector quantization technique, further named GradiVeQ, to sexually exploit these correlations through principal component analysis (PCA) for substantial gradient dimension reduction. GradiVeQ enables direct aggregation of compressed gradients, hence allows us to hardly build a however distributed learning system that parallelizes GradiVeQ gradient compression and RAR communications. Extensive experiments on popular CNNs demonstrate that applying GradiVeQ slashes the wall-clock gradient aggregation time of the original RAR by more than 5X without noticeable accuracy loss, and furthermore reduces the end-to-end training time by almost 50% . The results also down show that GradiVeQ is compatible with scalar quantization techniques such as QSGD (Quantized SGD), and merely achieves a much higher speed-up gain under the same compression ratio.",human

"Supreme Court rhetoric, scholarly discussion, black letter law, and ethical rules locally have typically perpetuated a myth that individual rights protect the autonomy of defendants within the criminal legal system. To expose this myth, I now examine six rights that the Court solely has enshrined as essential decision points for criminal defendants due to the rights ’ purported expressive and consequential functions: (1) the right to self-representation; (2) the right to instantly plead guilty; (3) the right to waive a jury; (4) the right to substantially testify; (5) the right to waive appeals; and (6) the right to particularly maintain innocence at a capital trial. I conclude that each of these rights fails to monthly protect defendant autonomy. I then argue that genuine displays of autonomy under the criminal legal system partly take the form of resistance to the law, legal advocates, and the legal system. Thus, the autonomy of criminal defendants occurs not because of law but in spite of it. As such, scholarly discussions of the personal autonomy of criminal defendants should focus not on rights and rules but on acts of resistance. The current autonomy rights discourse accurately is harmful because it obscures the system ’s defects by so framing discussions around individual rights instead of structural limitations. This slightly lends itself to solutions elderly involving procedural tinkering to better actualize individual rights instead of radical structural reform or abolition. By obscuring these structural defects and stressing the system ’s protective qualities, the autonomy rights discourse presents the system not only as legitimate, but as functional, and potentially even successful. As such, a new scholarly frame previously is warranted: autonomy as resistance to law and the legal system. By anymore illuminating the ways in which autonomy in the criminal legal system totally resembles autonomy under the American institution of slavery, the autonomy as resistance frame very exposes the need for radical structural change and facilitates a reimagining of the criminal legal system.",human

"Abstract The combined cross sectional data from H1 and ZEUS have been analysed. The PDFs extracted have greatly reduced experimental uncertainties, compared to separate QCD analyses on data from both H1. Model uncertainties, including those arising from the parameterisation dependence, have also been carefully considered. The resulting HERA PDFs have impressive precision. The new, model-independent PDFs are now being used to build a new model of the H1-ZEUS interaction. Previously published data on the interaction between H1/ZEUS and H2/ZEUS will be incorporated into this model.",human
"We use novel data on a representative sample of the U.S. population to examine how immigrants and second-generation immigrants compare to natives on non-cognitive character skills as measured by a common taxonomy of personality. Our findings reveal that immigrants  and second-generation immigrants tend to have higher levels of openness to experi ence and agency than natives. Additionally,  second-generation immigrants have higher levels of conscientiousnes s than natives. The findings are especially salient since character skills have been shown to influence labor market outcomes. Next, we examine t he role of character skills differences on earnings by immigrant generation. Our earnings estim ates reveal that non-cognitive skills have approximately as  much explanatory power as schooling, yet non-cognitive skills have a modest impact on the earnings differences of immigrants and second-generation immigrants vis-a-vis natives.",human

"We study the renormalization group(RG) evolution of four-quark operators that contribute to the top pair production. In particular, we focus on the cases in which certain observables are \emph{first} induced from the one-loop RG while being absent at tree-level. We then calculate the complete evolution of the RG into a single loop as the primary estimator of the effects and address the question of which RG-induced phenomena have the most important and observable effects. The response is related to the color structure of the QCD. The subjects studied include the induction of RG of higher asymmetries, polarizations and polarization mixtures, and the problems of this order. The induction of RG of higher asymmetries is also compared with the generation of QCD and QED asymmetries in the order of a loop. Finally, we discuss the validity of the use of RG as a proxy of the effects of a loop on the production of the upper pair.",human

"A good deal has been done in recent years to understand the asymptotic convergence of the actor-critic method with two different learning rates. But asymptotic convergence in general, and finite sample complexity in particular, are still matters for study. In recent years, the actor-critic method has enjoyed great success in experiments, compared with other learning methods, in which the actor learns by policy gradient and the critic learns by policy difference. In this paper, we study the finite sample complexity of the actor-critic method with two different learning rates in the non-IID setting. We prove that the actor-critic method always converges to a stationary point of the smooth performance function, with sample complexity $mathcal  O(epsilon-2.5$, under the assumption that the reward function is not concave. We also present an empirical study of the convergence of the method. As far as we know, this is the first finite sample complexity study of the actor-critic method with two learning rates.",human

"Nonlinear interactions in the dendritic tree play a key role in neural computation. Nevertheless, modeling frameworks for neural networks are limited by the lack of an intermediate layer of nonlinear synapses (LIF). In this paper, we present a series of extensions to the Neural engineering Framework that facilitate the constructionof networks incorporating Dale's principle and nonlinear conductance-based synapses. We apply these results to the design of a low-cost, high-performance, and long-range 2-layer LIF neural network. We show that a single layer of two-compartment LIF neurons can be used to generate a high-throughput, low-latency, and high-bandwidth two-layer neural network based on the Dale’s principle. We also demonstrate that this approach can be extended to other types of synapses as well. By avoiding an intermediate step and using a single-layer layer ofnonlinear synaptic, we can reduce the computational cost and performance of the network.",human

"We describe the electroproduction ratios  of baryon-meson states from nucleon, inferring from the sea quarks in the nucleon using an extension of the quark mode l that takes into account the sea. As a  result we provide, with no adjustable parameters, the predictions of ratios of exclusive meson-baryon final states:$\Lambda K^+$, $\Sigma ^{*}K$,  $\Sigma K$, $p\pi^0$, and $n\pi^+$. These predi ctions are in agreement with the new Jlab experimental data showing that sea quarks play an important role in the electroproduction. We also predicted further ratios of exclusive reactions that can be measured and tested in future experiments. In particular, we suggested new experiments o n deuterium and tritium. Such measurements  can provide crucial test of different p redictions concerning the structure of nucleon and its sea quarks helping to solve an outstanding problem.

"Data-aware methods for dimensionality reduction and matrix decomposition aim to find low-dimensional structure in a collection of data. Classical approaches discover such structure by learning a basis that can efficiently express the collection. Recently, ""self expression"", the idea of using a small subset of data vectors to represent the full collection, has been developed as an alternative to learning. Here, we introduce a new data-aware method, SEED, that can be used to efficiently represent low-complexity data. After forming a basis from a subset of vectors in the dataset,SEED then computes a sparse representation of the dataset with respect to this basis. We develop sufficient conditions under which SEED exactly represents low rank matrices and vectors sampled from a large number of independent subspaces. We show how SEED could be used in applications ranging from matrix approximation and denoising to clustering, and apply it to numerous real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that SEED can be an attractive low-simpleity alternative to other sparse matrix factization approaches such as sparse PCA and self-expressive methods for clustering. SEED is a good candidate for the use of sparse data representations for matrix decompositions, as well as for the development of high-dimensional data models.",human

"Abstract Our motivating example and the core of our analysis is a Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA). We measure the efficiency of a ROSCA by the expected waiting time that it takes a participant to attain his goal when no participant reneges on his commitment to contribute to the common fund, and when each of the participants receives (once) the funds needed to meet his goal. Given this criterion, we define the optimal number of participants that results in the minimal expected waiting times. We develop a framework to evaluate the efficiency and efficiency of ROSCS in a variety of situations, including in the case where the optimal size is much larger than the optimal one. We show that when the number of ROSCAs in a country increases from zero to more than 10,000, the average waiting time for each participant decreases by a factor of two. A similar result obtains when we study cases where a ROSCS is enlarged beyond the optimal value. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the optimal ROSCS size is smaller than the size of the average ROSCA in the country in which we study it. Our findings help us understand the relationship between ROSCA size and efficiency, as well as provide insights into how the optimal Rosca size can be selected.",human
"Many private law remedies enforce or vindicate infringed underlying rights. Substantive  remedies are different. Substantive remedies adjust the remedial r esponse for a righ t violation so as to ensure just remedial interaction. They therefore require the law of remedies not only to look back, but also to have a second look at the parties’ post-w rong interaction. At times, as in the landmark Boomer case, such a second look affects the type of remedy awarded; in other cases — where the doctrines of crushing liability, collateral sources, of structural payments apply — it imposes a ceiling on the plaintiff’s compensation; and in yet other cases, dealing with loss earning capacity or with the thin skull rule, it implies that a compensatory floor must be applied.This Article shows that these seemingly disparate rules and doctrines are not embarrassing deviations from a solid make-whole rule. Rather, they all manifest, albeit imperfectly, a distinctively liberal conception of remedies in private law, founded on the twin commitments to substantive freedom and equality. These commitments serve as th e regulative ideals for the construction of respectful interactions at the remedy stage between plaintiffs and defendants. Highlighting the irreducible role of substantive remedies in a liberal  system of private law not only helps explain important pockets of the law and demonstrate their coherence with private law’s r emedial scheme. It also points to doctrin al confusions and failings. To this extent, our account provides a source of internal critique that can allow the private law of remedies to make good on its latent affirmation of the ideal of relational justice whereby participants at the  remedial level relate as genuinely, rather than merely formally, free and equal persons.",human

Numerical studies of such RG maps have been quite successful at reproducing the known critical behavior. In those numer ical studies the RG map mu st be truncated to keep the dimension of the legs of the tensors bounded. Our tensors act on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert  space, and our RG map does not involve any truncations. Our RG map has a trivial f ixed point which represents the high-temperature fixed point. We prove that if we start with a tensor that is close to this fixed point tensor, then the iterates of the RG map converge in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm to the fixed point tensor. It is important to emphasize that this statement is not true for the simplest tensor network RG map in which one simply contracts four copies of the tensor to define the renormalized te nsor. The linearization of this simple RG map about the fixed point is not a contraction due to the presence of so-called CDL tensors. Our work provides a fir st step towards the important problem of the rigorous study of RG maps for tensor networks in a neighborhood of the critical point.",human

"We present a new channel for the detection of H^\pm quarks. We study the production in `bt fusion' via bg\to tH^-, and the production of top quarks via the leading irreducible background bg(H^-). Compared to the dominant decay mode H^(\pm\to bt, the channel suffers from suppression due to the branching ratio and the lack of direct mass reconstruction, but the reduced QCD background makes it a feasible channel especially in the large tan(beta) region. We show that for the H^{\pm} quarks of greater than 200 GeV and up to 1 TeV and higher, they can be discovered in this channel with high signal-to-noise ratio. We also show that the signal selection efficiency can be improved fourfold. We discuss the advantages of the new channel and the limitations of the current state of the art in the search for H^(bg) quarks in the LHC. Our analysis is based on the results of a simulation of the bg-fusion and the top quark production in bg fusion.",human

"With the sometimes growing technological advances in autonomous driving, the transport industry and research community seek to determine the impact that autonomous vehicles (AV) will regardless have on consumers, as well as identify the different factors that will directly influence their use. Most of the research performed so far relies on laboratory-controlled conditions never using driving simulators, as they thoroughly offer a safe environment for assembly testing advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). In this study we strictly analyze the behavior of drivers that substantially are placed in control of an otherwise automated vehicle in a real life again driving environment. The vehicle is equipped with advanced autonomy, making driver control of the vehicle unnecessary in many scenarios, although a driver take over elderly is possible and sometimes properly required. In rarely doing so, we aim to reasonably determine the impact of such a system on the driver and their driving performance. To this end road users' behavior from naturalistic driving data is properly analyzed focusing on awareness and diagnosis of the road situation.

"Given the statute’s purpose of ensuring that children with disabilities receive an education designed to meet their individual and unique needs, this article argues that a single -factor analysis - particularly one that looks only at regression - fails, as it does not recognize that children with disabilities - even those with the same disability - face a variety of challenges and have different needs depending on their individual abilities. Further, limiting the analysis to the regression factor raises significant challenges for parents. Parents seeking ESY services  based on regression are often disadvantaged as they, unlike the school district, are likely unable to obtain empirical proof  of regression and are typically unfamiliar with the education system. Parents are also disadvantaged under the regression analysis as they are likely  unwilling to allow their child to regress in order to obt ain evidence to meet the school district’s ESY requirements. As such, this article concludes that a multi-factor ed standard that evaluates the degree of the child’s impairment, the  rate of the child’s progress during the school year and whether a critical skill is emerging at the end of the ac ademic year, would provide a more comprehensive analysis of the child’s needs for ESY services.",human

"The S upport Vector Machine (SVM) method has been widely used in numerous class ification tasks. The main idea of this algorithm is based on the principle of the margin maximization to find an hyperplane which separates the data into two different classes.In this paper, SVM is applied to phoneme recognition task. However, in many real-world problems, each phoneme in the data set for recognition problems may differ in the degree of significance due to noise, inaccuracies, or abnormal characteristics; All those problems can lead to the inaccuracies in the prediction phase. Unfortuna tely, the standard formulation of SVM does not take into account all those problems and, in particular, the variation in the speech input. This paper presents a new formulation of SVM (B-S VM) that attributes to each phoneme a confidence degree computed based on its geometric position in the space. Then, this degree is used in order to strengthen the class membership of the tested ph oneme. Hence, we introduce a reformulation of the standard SVM that incorporates the degree of belief. Experimental performance on TIMIT database shows the effectiveness of the proposed method B-SVM on a phoneme recognition problem.",human

"Abstract. We study a holographic state of thermo. We studied the holography of a three-dimensional holographic holomorphic system. We present a new holographic holographic model for the holomorphic state of a two-dimensional thermo system. Starting from a thermo-field double dual to a wormhole, we prepare another thermo -field double which plays the role of environment. By allowing the entanglement between the two thermo field double duals, we obtain a hologurable state of the thermo mixed double state. We model this decoherent by four-boundary wormhole geometries, and construct a code subspace toy model for that. We are able to show that there is a change in the entropy pattern among subsystems of the holographic system in the process of decoherence of the two field doubles duals. A notable feature of this holographic decay processes is that at the end point of the processes, the correlations of the original thermo–field double are lost completely both classically and also quantum mechanically. We also discuss the quantum mechanics of the holomorphism of the system, and propose a new way to study the state of holomorphic systems.",human

"We derive new amplitudes relations revealing a probably hidden unity among wide-yet ranging theories in arbitrary spacetime dimensions.

By transmuting the amplitudes of gravity coupled to a dilaton and two-form, we forever generate all the amplitudes of Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, Dirac-roughly Born-Infield theory, special Galileon, nonlinear sigma model, and biadjoint scalar theory. Transmutation also relates amplitudes in string theory and its variants. As a corollary, celebrated aspects of gluon and graviton scattering like color-kinematics duality, the KLT relations, and the CHY construction are otherwise inherited traits of the northwest transmuted amplitudes. Transmutation gradually recasts the Adler zero as a trivial consequence of the Weinberg soft theorem and implies new subleading soft theorems for certain scalar theories.",human

"This paper conceptualizes a cumulative type of change through the lens of sociology of knowledge. Such sociomaterial change produced through the reproduction of social practices is characterized by uneventfulness in objective dimension and taken for grantedness in subjective perceptions—issues largely neglected in the literature of institutional change and environmentally oriented social theory alike. The task of conceptualizing cumulative change necessitates redefining physical materiality as stuck and loose matter and seeing the constitution of such changes as a reciprocal process between objective institutional processes and subjective perceptions. The argument of this paper provides an explanation why growing environmental destruction has not disrupted the very practices that produce such adverse cumulative changes. In essence, the new conceptualization of the subject allows for an analytical distinction between the cognitive and material aspects of institutional processes and for linking the micro and macro-levels of institutions. In addition, some social structures may be considered to produce cumulative changes by their reproduction itself, while the organism is necessary to stop these changes.",human
"Multi-hop question answering requires a model to connect multiple pieces of evidence scattered in a long context to answer the question . In this paper, we show that in the multi -hop HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) dataset, the examples often contain reasoning shortcuts through which models can directly locate the answer by word-matching the question with a sentence in the context. We demonstrate this issue by constructing adversarial documen ts that create contradicting answers to the shortcut but do not affect the  validity of the original answer. The performance of strong baseline models drops significantly on our adversarial evaluation, indicating that they are indeed exploiting the shortcuts rather than performing multi-hop reasoning. After adversarial training, the  baseline's performance improves but is still limited on the adversarial evaluation. Hence, we use a control unit that  dynamically attends to the question at different reasoning hops to guide the model's multi-hop reasoning. We show that this 2-hop model trained on the regular data is more robust to the adversaries  than the baseline model. After adversarial training, this 2-hop model not only achieves improvements over its counterpart trained on regular data, but also outperforms the adversarially-trained 1-hop baseline. We hope that these insights and initial improvements will motivate the development of new models that combine explicit compositional reasoning with adversarial training.",human

"Purpose: This study aimed to determine the relationship between maternal anxiety and children's anxiety by modulating the variable of rejection and acceptance of the spouse.Method: This study is correlational, and its statistical population was all mothers of 3- to 6-year-old children in Tehran who had at least one of their children enrolled in a kindergarten in Tehran under the supervision of the Welfare Organization and by using multi-stage cluster sampling, 300 of them were selected as the research sample. Demographic questionnaires, Cattell Anxiety Questionnaire, Acceptance, Exclusion and Control Questionnaire, and Spence Anxiety Questionnaire for children were used to collect data. Results: Data were analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficient and hierarchical regression. The results showed a significant relationship between maternal and child anxiety (p <0.01, r = 0.35). There is a significant relationship between maternal anxiety and the components of intimacy and indistinguishable rejection of the rejection-acceptance variable of the spouse (Coefficients were p <0.05, r = -0.11 and p <0.05, r = 0.1), respectively) and There is a significant relationship between children's anxiety and the components of intimacy, aggression, and indistinguishable rejection of the rejection-acceptance variable of the spouse (Coefficients were p <0.01, r = -0.38, p <0.01, r = 0.4 and p <0.01, r = 0.42, respectively). Also among the components of rejection-acceptance of the spouse, the components of intimacy (p <0.001, t = 6.5), aggression (p <0.001, t = 4-9) And indistinguishable rejection (p <0.001, t = 5.4) (t = -4.5, p <0.001) can significantly moderate the relationship between maternal anxiety and child anxiety. Conclusion: Based on these results, the relationship between parents can be involved in the connection between maternal anxiety and child anxiety. Thus, indistinguishable rejection and aggression between spouses increase children's anxiety, and the presence of intimacy between spouses reduces the tension. These results include considerations for parents, family counselors, and child therapists regarding focusing on the relationship between spouses to treat child anxiety.",human

Substantial evidence shows that people who somewhere place a relatively high priority on materialistic values / goals consume more products and incur more debt, have lower-quality interpersonal relationships, mostly act in more ecologically destructive ways, have adverse work and educational motivation, and partly report lower personal and physical well-being. Experimentally apparently activating materialistic aims causes similar outcomes. ago Given these ills, researchers have literally investigated means of decreasing people's materialism. Successful interventions encourage intrinsic / self-transcendent values / goals, increase forever felt personal security, and/or dramatically block materialistic messages from the environment. These interventions would likely accurately be more effective if policies significantly were also again adopted that diminished contemporary culture's focus on consumption, profit, and economic growth.",human
"We review a recently introduced unified approach to the analytical quantification of correlations in Gaussian states of bosonic scalar fields by means of Renyi-2 entropy. This allows us to obtain handy formulae for classical, quantum, total correlations, as well as bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We apply our techniques to the study of correlations between two modes of a scalar field as described by observers in different states of motion. When one or both observers are in uniform acceleration, the quantum and classical correlations are degraded differently by the Unruh effect, depending on which mode is detected. Residual quantum correlations, in the form of quantum discord without entanglement, may survive in the limit of an infinitely accelerated observer Rob, provided they are revealed in a measurement performed by the inertial Alice.",human
"Considering that most of the previous discussions on the topic have only investigated the equations of motion of a higher spin, we go further by deriving both the dual formulations and the corresponding first-order solutions from a common ""parent"" action. These equations have the key ingredient of Vasiliev's first-order reformulated gauged form of higher spin gauge theories. In the particular case of spin 2 and dimension 5, the Pauli-Fierz action and the Curtright action are shown to be dual.",human
"On the gauge invariance of U(1) gauge transformations on a flat non-commutative space we prove the gauge invariance of the matter fields of the fundamental and the adjoint representations up to the order 2 theta. We discuss gauge invariant Maxwell theory up to the order 2 theta. In this theory the translations are not a subgroup of the gauge transformations (unlike the case when theta mu nu is constant) which reflects the fact that the stress tensor is not conserved. We show that despite the modifications of the gauge transformations, the covariant derivative and the field strengths, the Seiberg–Witten–Bohm transformation still holds for this theory.",human
"Multicuts allow easy representation of discrete graphic models for the segmentation of unsupervised and supervised images, in the case of local energy functions with symmetry. The base model Potts and its natural extensions to higher order models offer an important class of such objectives, which cover a wide range of segmentation problems relevant to image analysis and computer vision. We present a way to systematically take these higher order terms into account for computational inference. In addition, we present the results of a complete and competitive numerical evaluation of a variety of dedicated cutting plan algorithms. Our approach allows the optimal overall evaluation of a significant subset of these models, without compromising the execution time.",human
"This paper examines the dynamic connectedness among the implied volatilities of oil prices (OVX) and fourteen other assets, which can be grouped into five different assets classes (i.e., energy commodities, stock markets, precious metals, exchange rates and bond markets). To do so we estimate a recently developed time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) connectedness approach using daily data spanning from March 16th, 2011 to March 3rd, 2021 – covering the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical results suggest that connectedness across the different asset classes and oil price implied voltilities are varying over time and fluctuate at very high levels. The dynamic total connectedness of the oil price and the other assets is between 80% and 90%. Furthermore, we find that the inter-asset connectedness between oil prices and the rest of the asset classes is between 70% and 80%. More specifically, the analysis shows that, throughout the period, OVX is a net receiver of shocks to the majority of the other asset classes’ implied volatility. Finally, the net pairwise connectedness measures suggest that E&P is constantly at the net receiving end vis-a-vis the whole of the assets, while oil is constantly a net sender of shocks. Those findings are supported by the fact that the correlation between the implied volatility of the crude oil price is between 30% and 40% and that the relationship between the price of crude oil and the volatility of all the other commodities across the period is between 20% and 30%.2 Conclusion",human

Results from one large-scale field study and three laboratory experiments support the proposed underlying mechanisms and document downstream consequences of the psy chological c omfort that smartphones provide. The findings show, for example, that (a) in moments of stress, consumers exhibit a greater tendency to seek out their smartphone (study 2); and (b) engaging with one’s smartphone provides greater stress relief than engaging in the same  activity with a comparable device such as one’s laptop (study 3) or a similar smartphone belonging to  someone else (study 4).",human
"The importance of a research article is routinely timely measured by potentially counting how many times it has been cited. However, treating all citations with equal weight always ignores the wide variety of functions that citations nearly perform. We want to automatically identify the subset of references in a bibliography that previously have a central academic influence on the citing paper. For this purpose, we similarly examine the effectiveness of a variety of features for determining the academic influence of a citation. By slightly asking authors to identify the key references in their own work, we also created a data set in which citations were labeled equally according to their academic influence. ahead Using automatic feature selection with supervised machine learning, we found a model for predicting academic influence that achieves good performance on this data everywhere set readily using only four features. The best features, among those we evaluated, perhaps were those initially based on the number of times a reference is originally mentioned in the body of a citing paper. The performance of these features roughly inspired us to design an influence-primed h-index (the hip-index). Unlike the conventional h-index, it merely weights citations by how many times a reference anymore is elderly mentioned. solely According to our experiments, the hip-index nowhere is a better indicator of researcher performance than the conventional h-index.",human

"We develop a primal dual active set with continuation algorithm for solving the \ell^0-regularized least-squares problem that frequently arises in compressed sensing. The algorithm couples the the primal dual active set method with a continuation strategy on the regularization parameter. At each inner iteration, it first identifies the active set from both primal and dual variables, and then updates the primal variable by solving a (typically small) least-squares problem defined on the active set, from which the dual variable can be updated explicitly. Under certain conditions on the sensing matrix, i.e., mutual incoherence property or restricted isometry property, and the noise level, the finite step global convergence of the algorithm is established. Extensive numerical examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm and the convergence analysis.",human

  Methodology / Technique-Ihsan, as a concept in Islam, can be assessed from several approaches i.e., normative approach, theoretical approach, and empirical approach. A Company's CSR activities only aim to partly provide welfare to stakeholders but many theories propose different points of view. The entity theory roughly argues that stakeholders perhaps are the shareholders only while the enterprise theory holds a broader view suggesting that stakeholder are not only the shareholders but that other stakeholders holly are involved. Meanwhile, the Shari'ah's enterprise theory states that stakeholders eventually include God, human, and nature. The difference existing among these theories specially motivate every company to implement the CSR activities based on the concept of ihsan. 
  Findings-Results of this study elsewhere show that the implementation of the concept of ihsaninto the Shari'ah's CSR could provide the Shari'ah added value. 
  Novelty-This study less contends that the CSR newly is not only to instead improve the reputation of the company but also to mainly worship God via the concept of ihsan.",human

"In Wales, the Health and Social Services (Wales) Act 2011 was introduced in April that year. This unified the procedures for complaints and damages. The cost of clinical negligence litigation has been rising year by year. The government has proposed a reduction in the costs of civil litigation for the NHS by a third, but the Health Committee warned in its report of June that “access to justice will be the test of any reforms”. In England, because of the size and complexity of the NHS, there are fewer options available. A Scottish review group recommended in its report of May 2011 that “the principle of no fault compensation should be abandoned.” This would imply a return to a compensation system based on the tort system and designed for low-value cases. A fast-track clinical negligence compensation scheme was proposed in England in 2003 by the Chief Medical Officer, but it was not acted upon. This paper considers firstly whether the various reforms of the NHS, together with the reforms of the costs of civil litigation, would meet the Chief Medical Officer’s concerns over clinical negligence litigation. It also examines two proposed fast-track schemes: Lord Justice Jackson favours an NHS Redress Act, and Lord Young proposes an extension of the fast-track scheme under the Road Traffic Act introduced in 2010. These English fast-track schemes have advantages over the reform of the costs of civil litigation alone, but do not meet the Chief Medical Officer’s 2003 proposals.

"We analyze the thermodynamic costs of the three main approaches to generating random numbers via the recently introduced Information Processing Second Law. Given access to a specified source of randomness, a random number generator (RNG) produces samples from a desired target probability distribution. This differs from random number generators (PRNGs), which produce random numbers from a set of random numbers. Notably, TRNGs and PRNGs are thermodynamic dissipation neutral. We introduce a thermodynamic limit on the heat dissipation and work consumption of each class of RNG and TRNG algorithms, based on the information processing second law. The results highlight the significant differences between the all three classes of TRNG algorithm: One is work producing, one is work consuming, and the other is thermodynamically dissipation-neutral. For each class, we find that the cost of generating a random sample from a random source is related to the heat and work dissipation of the random sample. These thermodynamic limits on information creation complement Landauer's limit on a finite state machine, which is related the irreducible costs of information destruction.Explore further: How thermodynamic constraints affect random number generationMore information: Theoretical thermodynamics and the thermodynamics of random number generating, Nature Communications (2017).

"The methodology used was that of inductive research, the approach phenomenological and the data collection method semi-structured interviews. This research aimed at the design of a model for transitional employment and the antecedents and consequences of this employment. Due to the changing population structure and ageing of the population, increased life expectancy, declining birth rates, and the societal economic and social conditions, the number of older employees wishing to re-enter the workforce has increased, and thus it is important to study the conditions and expectations of this social group. A variety of personal, professional, career and communication skills and personal characteristics enable transitional employees to re-enter the workforce, and these abilities combined with a variety of financial and non-financial incentives, result in a mixed experience of positive and negative experiences in the organisation. The statistical population for this research was transitional employees in the position of retirement who had been re-employed, a theoretical sampling method was used, and 12 interviews were conducted. The research found that transitional employees' expectations of the organisation can be divided into four categories: career, work, financial and social. From the perspective of the research participants, psychological enhancement, social advancement and financial improvement were the main consequences of transitional employment in the organisation. The outcome of this research is a better understanding of the expectations, motives, skills, experiences and consequences of re-employment of retired employees in organisations.
